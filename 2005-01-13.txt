I am going to keep track of my daily events and thoughts here. Strictly confidential!

Today I've listened to a guy named Jerry Fiddler, he's a former CEO of WindRiver (vxWorks, if I understand it correctly) and he mentioned something about the way real world evolves and how it is different from the way we thing of evolution in software development. I am almost certain we will see the natural evolution approaches implemented in some form in future software projects. Millions of changes will be introduced at a time and life will sort it out revealing those that are good and those that did not survive natural selection process.

I've received the letter from Immigration saying that my documents have arrived and are ready to be sent to the lawyers. I also went to listen to the presentation regarding the new program the department of labour have implemented - PERM - and it doesn't look very promising. The prospect of getting labour certifications approved in two months instead of two - three years is thrilling, but the scrutiny with which they are going to approach applications not make me very happy. We'll see, of course. Maybe it's not that scary.

Another thing about the Green Card - I'll have to stick around at Applied for an indefinite period of time (if I won't get laid off earlier, of course) and it doesn't make me happy. There are no open software positions at the company at this moment and it doesn't look like there will be something in the nearest future. Again, we will have to wait and see.

In the meantime I really should start completing our Canada immigration documents and file them as soon as possible!

Tomorrow I will figure out what's wrong with my local MovableType installation and why it won't let me create top level categories. I will also add some subcategories to this Journal and will try to split events and thoughts into personal, work-related, business-related and others. That's it for today!
