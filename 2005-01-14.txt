So, my yesterdays problem with not being able to create subcategories - I put mt.js in the wrong place.

Rina's mom received her passport with the visa, we've started shopping for tickets for her and then package to Hawaii for all three of us.

I've also installed the picture gallery software on our website while Rina is cropping and editing our pictures from Toronto.
