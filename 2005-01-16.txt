Weekends were quite slow. Saturday was wasted entirely. I was just relaxing, reading news, listening to 'casts and procrastinating. On sunday we went to see "Meet the Fockers" with Sam and Olga. Excellent movie, it turned out even funnier than "Meet the parents" - a rare treat in the world of sequels. Then, after the movie, Sam invited us for a cup of tea. We watched the О.С.П. - very funny russian show descended from Novosibirsk К.В.Н. team. They were interviewing some russian TV show hostess (Dana Something?) and she was just hilarious. On the edge of stupid but very funny indeed.
