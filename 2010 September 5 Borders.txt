The Borders of Santana Row is a typical big book store with the typical clientele. Adrienne and I are sitting on the second-floor terrace of the store. People on the terrace talk quietly. The terrace is not too big but it is not too small either. It's bracketed by a couple of trees on both sides - an ivi on the left and a palm tree on the right. I love it when leaves and branches are touching the human-built structure. There's deep intimacy in that. The trees are embracing and accepting our unnatural selves. Or maybe they just want to strangle us - who knows?

Down on the street there is a lazy Sunday afternoon commotion of cars and people. Santana Row is a busy place on any day, but is certainly so on a Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless, the buzz of the streets is somehow subdued and absorbed by the plentiful trees and the air itself. An occasional truck passes by, disturbing this semi-quietness and then everything is back to normal. Couples and families are walking up and down the streets, a Mexican band is playing in the distance. Not even a slow WiFi or the lack of power outlets can change my mood. Life is pretty good.
