First of all, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you're going to find yourself in. If you're not qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there's no need to bring the implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a problem on an ice climbing trip. Second, I'm only going to list the approximate contents of a climbing-specific first aid kit. To learn how to use it is your responsibility.

Rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall. The things that can go wrong in a fall include spinal injuries, head trauma, bone fractures, muscle and tendon tears, skin lacerations, joint dislocations, sprains, abrasions, burns, blisters, and so on. Spinal and head injuries require rapid evacuation and there's very little you can do to help your patient - backboards and head immobilization devices are bulky and therefore you're unlikely to carry them with you on a climbing trip. Compound fractures, deep lacerations and crush wounds also require immediate evacuation. However, you should be able to stop the bleeding, dress the wounds and splint an injured limb. Some joint dislocations could be reduced in the field (e.g.: shoulder or finger), other will require qualified help and in some cases specialized equipment - evacuation is in order. Finally, sprains, abrasions, rope burns and flappers could be treated in the field with a few simple supplies. Here's the approximate list of items for a climbing-specific first aid kit:

 - Non-latex gloves
 - Assortment of sterile wound dressings, bandages and gauzes
 - Triangular bandages with a few safety pins
 - Universal aluminum splint (SAM or wire mesh splint)
 - Assortment of bandaids
 - Blister treatment
 - Alcohol wipes
 - Antibiotic ointment
 - Adhesive tape
 - Pain killers
 - Tweezers
 - Chemical ice pack
 - Chemical heat pad
 - Mylar rescue blanket
 - Notepad and pencil
