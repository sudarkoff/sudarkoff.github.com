First, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you're going to find yourself in. If you're not qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there's no need to bring the implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a problem on an ice climbing trip. Second, I'll leave alone the environmental threats and overuse injuries and focus on climbing-specific traumatic injuries.

Rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall. The things that can go wrong in a fall include spinal injuries, head traumas, joint dislocations, sprains, bone fractures, muscle and tendon tears, skin cuts, abrasions, burns, blisters, etc.

Spinal and head injuries require rapid evacuation and there's very little you can do to help your patient (backboards and head immobilization devices are bulky and therefore you're unlikely to carry them with you on a climbing trip).
