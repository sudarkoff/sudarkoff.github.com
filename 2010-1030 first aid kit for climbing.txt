I'll focus on injuries that are specific to rock climbing. That means I am not going to talk about insect bites, frostbites, heat exhaustion and other non-climbing-specific problems.

Rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall. What are the things that can go wrong in a fall? Dislocations, sprains, fractures, cuts, abrasions, flappers TK, concussions...
