First, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you're going to find yourself in. If you're not qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there's no need to bring the implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a problem on an ice climbing trip. Second, I'll leave alone the environmental threats and overuse injuries and focus only on climbing-specific traumatic injuries. Third, I'm not going to describe the treatments, only the contents of the first aid kit - it's a good idea to take a Wilderness First Aid training if you're serious about outdoors.

Rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall. The things that can go wrong in a fall include spinal injuries, head traumas, bone fractures, muscle and tendon tears, skin lacerations, joint dislocations, sprains, abrasions, burns, blisters, etc. Spinal and head injuries require rapid evacuation and there's very little you can do to help your patient - backboards and head immobilization devices are bulky and therefore you're unlikely to carry them with you on a climbing trip. Compound fractures, deep lacerations and crush wounds also require immediate evacuation. However, you should be able to stop the bleeding, dress the wound and splint the injured limb. Some simple joint dislocations could be reduced in the field without any equipment (shoulders, fingers), others will require qualified help and in some cases specialized equipment - evacuation is in order. Finally, sprains, abrasions, burns and blisters could be treated with gauses, 

a good assortment of bandaids, blister treatment, wound dressings, alcohol wipes, antibiotic ointment, adhesive tape, pain killers, antidiarrheal medicine, tweezers, a few safety pins, a few pieces of paper and a pencil.

I usually also add some water treatment tablets, a space blanket, SAM or aluminum wire mesh splint, a chemical ice pack and a chemical heat pad.
