# I am not a climber

How we self-identify determines how we live our lives. You say - "I'm a runner" - and you make a conscious effort to run regularly. You're passionate about, you read running magazines, subscribe to running blogs and so on and so forth. Running is who you are. You're not a surfer, even though you enjoy it; you're not a mountain biker, even though you probably have more injuries from that than from running (and isn't that a measure of some sort)? Heck, you probably even spend more time singing at your local choir, but you're not a singer - you're a runner. Why is that? What makes you a runner and not a surfer/biker/singer?
