As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen). I've tried my hand at translating a couple of them into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability to express myself in a foreign landuage), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted a translation of the shortest and least rhymed one. Here's the result:

Your face is a ripe peach
On it rottenness has no place
Very, very boring face...

Ñ 1995 Ñ

It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it's better rhymed now :-)
