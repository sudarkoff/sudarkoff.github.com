Our trip to Toronto.

First of all, they sat us separately on our flight from San Jose to Chicago. As a result I was heavily entertained by a couple of very noisy kids for good three hours and even an iPod couldn't overXXX the noise these two were producing. Then another short flight to Buffalo where our friend from Canada met us and we went to the closest restaurant serving buffalo wings. Wings were okay (no worse, no better than in San Francisco). On our way to Toronto, when crossing the border, another happy incident have happened - were passed without ever showing our papers. Not a single time. First, we thought okay, we are crossing customs, they don't want to see our passports.

Our friend (F): I am a landed immigrant and these are my friends from the U.S.
Customs officer (C): Where did you get them?
F: Buffalo airport.
C: Did you buy anything?
F: No.
C: Bye!

Then, when we saw the sign "Niagara on the lake" we thought: "Well, there seems to be no chance of seeing the immigration control so deep into Canada". First, we thought: "Wow! That was quite a board crossing!" But then we thought: "Damn! What if we are going to have problems on our way back because of this?" So we turned around and drove good twenty kilometers back to the immigration control. Went there and asked two Canadian officers if we are okay. They looked at us as if we were insane and told us to have some vodka and relax (I am not kidding). When we finally came to Toronto the still laying around snow was very rapidly melting. Weather turned around and decided to welcome us with temperatures above zero (Celsius).
