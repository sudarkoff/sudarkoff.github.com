Using IRC-like channel with bot keeping track of the specially formatted messages and generating web page afterwards might be a good idea for group brainstorming sessions and could work like this:

Joe> Bob: shell we discuss the today's meeting agenda?
Bob> Why not
Joe> bot: start Agenda
bot> starting Agenda
Joe> 1. Introduction
Joe> 2. Discuss coding style
Bob> Let's postpone coding style until Jack is back from Tokyo
Joe> Yes, sounds like a good idea
Joe> bot, remove (2)
Joe> 2. Discuss release notes for beta1.5
Joe> 2.1. List known bugs
Bob> 2.2 Who's translating RN into Spanish?
Joe> bot: publish Agenda
bot> Agenda published at http://company.com/internal/2004-04-23/agenda.html
