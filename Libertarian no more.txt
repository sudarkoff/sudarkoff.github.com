# why I no longer call myself a libertarian

I love liberty, no question about it. I do believe the federal government is way too big and has way too much power. And local governments should have more rights, of course. But I do not call myself a libertarian any longer. 

First of all, there's a constant debate among libertarians on what "libertarian" means. Is it small government or no government? Is it completely free market or minimally regulated market? I don't like black and white reasoning. Real life is alway more complex than  that.

But on top of that, we are highly social creatures by nature. We are evolved to live in large tightly knit communities of around 150 people or so. In a community of that size, where everybody knows each other, sharing becomes the way of life. And it looks more like socialism rather than capitalism. Since the group can keep track of each others good deeds, you don't need the market mechanism to maintain good relationships and order. 

The way we live in a modern western society is highly unnatural. We organize ourselves in tiny independent units called families, which sometimes organize into small loosely connected communities, which are then governed by state and federal laws.

This organization makes us feel disconnected when we're the weakest. And not very well plugged into our community even when things are great and we presumably do not feel the need for support.
