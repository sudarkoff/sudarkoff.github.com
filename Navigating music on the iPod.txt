I have some 100+ Gb of music on my hard drive. Not long ago I almost lost 40% of it because I didn't have enough room left on my hard drive at the time and thus removed everything I had stored on my iPod. Which, in turn, failed while I was jogging with it and wouldn't recognize the library. Fortunately, iTunes did a great job fixing the problem (after few hours of my unsuccessful attempts to do it manually with some very low-level tools), so I am fine now (and hurray to Apple!) and looking for a hand strap.

Now, to listen to it all, one would probably need 10 years. That is, if he makes it his full-time job - 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. So, why on Earth do I keep it all? Because I like to be surprised. Because I prefer having full albums as opposed to just a few "best hits" carefully selected by the mainstream media. Because I listen to very wide range of genres, styles and languages. And, finally, because buying it all is dirt-cheap if you use service like allofmp3.com, where you pay $0.01 for 1Mb of music.

But to manage it all, is not just difficult, it is <em>very</em> difficult.

After long struggle with trying to sort through my huge collection of music and making it easier to navigate it on the iPod I have finally came up with the schema that works for me. It is still very sketchy, but as I think it might as well work for somebody else or someone could comment on it and influence its improvement, here's how I do it.

From the very beginning I had an idea in mind that there could be no more that just a few useful rules to follow, otherwise the amount of attention needed to perform the task would distract from enjoying the music, which in the end is what it's all for. Rules cannot be too complex, they should be intuitive, easy to comprehend and following them should produce accurate results. The most complex rules should be executed once or very rarely.

My conditions are somewhat atypical, thus bear with me as I describe them, so that you don't argue with the points that are not applicable to my situation. First of all, I rarely use iTunes to listen to my music collection, 99 per cent of the time it's the sound coming from my iPod. It would certainly be easier to use iTunes when sitting in front of my workstation in the office (where I spend 90 per cent of my listening time), but unfortunately we still have Windows NT 4 ruling our desktops around here. Therefore the main goal was to make navigation easy on iPod.

Second, to me Trip-Hop and Hip-Hop are the same deal and I listen to way too many different music styles to care about accurate genre names too much. And it makes no difference for me whatsoever whether it's Hard Rock or Speed Metal, Traditional Jazz or Acid Jazz. Besides, sometimes it's really difficult to attribute the piece to a single genre. For instance, in case of "Paper Music" by Bobby McFerrin it's just as much Jazz as it is Classical (to my subjective taste, anyway). In my mind genre is just another reference point and there could be no more that just a few of them, otherwise they'll make a mess instead of an order. (Of course, it would help to have hierarchical genres support in iTunes/iPod, but let's work with whatever resources we have at our hands, shell we?)

Finally, I virtually have no playlists that are not smart, auto-updated playlists. Being the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=uber-geek" title="Urban Dictionary: definition of the word "uber-geek"">Ã¼ber-geek</a> I am, I like things happening automatically with a little to no extra effort on my part.

All this combined lead to the following set of rules. First, it's what to do in iTunes:

<ol>
<li>Keep genres limited to the very basic ones (Rock, Jazz, Classical... See for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_genres).</li>
<li>Use the Grouping field to specify sub-genre and non-genre-related reference points (such as "Russian", "Children", "Adult Language", etc.)</li>
<li>Do not use "Various Artists" unless it really is the song performed by the guy named Various Artists</li>
<li>Create set of smart auto-updated playlists:</li>
<ul><li>For every genre create a playlist "Best of [Genre]" that includes titles rated four stars or higher</li>
<li>Create "Best of All" playlist that includes titles rated five stars</li>
<li>Create "Never Listened" playlist with zero PlayCount - this is what I listen to, when I want to be "surprised"</li>
<li>Create "Not Rated" playlist that includes unrated titles with non-zero PlayCount - often I don't bother rating songs as I listen to them, then later I can go through this playlist and rate songs post factum</li>
<li>"[Group]" and "Best of [Group]" (i.e. "Russian", "Best of Russian Rock").</li>
</ul>
<li>I also have few "dumb" playlists to put together </li>
</ol>

Then, on your iPod, as you listen to the song, rate it according to the following table:

<table>
<tr>
  <td>***** (5 stars)</td>
  <td>Absolutely the best song!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>**** (4 stars)</td>
  <td>Best song in its genre</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>*** (3 stars)</td>
  <td>I like this song</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>** (2 stars)</td>
  <td>This song is okay</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>* (1 star)</td>
  <td>Bad song (OR the quality of the track is not good)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<ol>
<li>As you listen to the tune for the first time, rate it three stars if it's good, four stars if it's best in the genre and five stars if it's absolutely best</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
