# sudarkoff.com

A Hugo-based site for George Sudarkoff's coaching practice.

The site is built and deployed with a workflow (see .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml) to the `gh-pages` branch.

Note that at the moment the site is a handcrafted html served from the `handcrafted-html` branch, because the Hugo version is under development.
