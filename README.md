# Lead with the confidence you grew accustomed to as a technical expert!

**Before working with me:** You’re not sure of yourself, you feel overwhelmed by your new responsibilities. Maybe you’re even thinking about going back to being an individual contributor.

**After working with me:** You are a self-aware, confident, and influential leader. You lead with integrity, empathy, and gratitude. You’re an expert delegator and an authentic communicator.

**“I’m just no longer sure of myself, I feel overwhelmed by my new responsibilities.”** I often hear these words from my clients—some of the best technical experts in their fields.
        
You see, most newly minted engineering managers think… “the years I spent honing my technical skills will give me **authority and influence in my new role**.” But the truth is… leaders are not admired for their technical skills—**what got you here won’t get you there!**
        
Most new technical leaders think… that if they read the right book, or take the right course they’ll finally **feel confident in their leadership abilities**. The truth is… it’s not about acquiring more knowledge, **it’s about letting go of your old habits and expectations**.
        
Most new managers think... that confidence means no longer having fear. The truth is... **confident leaders walk towards their fear**.
        
Here’s the good news—with your leadership potential, **you are only scratching the surface of the impact you could have**! I promise, if you take the lessons and put in the work, you can and will become an extraordinary leader faster than you actually believed possible.⁠
