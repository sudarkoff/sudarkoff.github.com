As I was falling asleep yesterday, my mind was still busy trying to solve some of the problems I was facing at work during the day. (Yes, I work on weekends - cleanroom apparatus are a very busy resource in our project and I am lucky to get weekends.) Anyway, my brain was processing the data and as I was falling deeper into the Morpheus' realm (no, not that Morpheus, you pathetic ignorant sci-fi junky) the reality of my dream started warping and in about few turns I was already solving real-world problem of effective disgize for the secret service men.

I was thinking, why don't we separate content - the agent person - from it's representation - whatever form he or she is in at the moment. This way, with simple CSS trick we'll be able to morph agent's appearance almost at will and catching him or her will be practically impossible with conventional methods (of course, there's always a Biasian analisys, I was thinking, but it doesn't work very well).

So, as you can see, I solved the actual real-world problem in a fraction of a second and how elegant and simple the solution was! I woke up enlightened!.. But unfortunately, as some russian joke goes, "stick has two ends" not exactly a Nobel-prise-worthy discovery. 

It's amazing how our digital real-world solutions don't fit the real real-world problems. Our imaginary world is so valnurable and fragile, so impractical and, well, imaginary. And yet it's should be quite powerfull if despite its being so imaginary it nonetheless changes this real world bit by bit every day.

Hurray to the High-Tech!
