WHY I CLIMB

Why do I climb? "Because I'm in love!" â€” said William Shattner (AKA Captain Kirk) TK. But it's the same sort of answer as the infamous "because it's there" - not a very good answer, that is. Why DO I climb?

Some years ago, I was maybe 10 or 12, our family was living in a small military town on the East coast of the Japan sea. I was roaming free - thanks to a relative safety of a military surroundings. My friends and I are played in the woods, we played around the town - we played everywhere we could find what to play with. One of our semi-secluded spots was a small crag of maybe TK feet tall above a row of garages. We started by just hiding there from the adult supervision, then we moved to burning fires, trashing discarded car batteries and melting led into various shapes - for fishing weights, primarily - something most of us wouldn't have the real need for. When we got bored with that, somebody had noticed, that we were sitting with our backs agains a slabby rock face not even TK feet tall. Shall we climb it?

Years have passed, I moved to Siberia for 11 years, then to Silicon Valley for 10 years. But I always had this bug in me - I wanted to go rock climbing. Finally, I asked around if anybody would be interested in joining me. I had no responses and then I find out that a few of my friends had been climbing for a couple of weeks without telling me. I jumped in, passed my belay test and started on the upwards motion through the grades. On my TK week I climbed a slabby 5.10c - I still love slabs. In fact, the TK wall at PGSV sorta reminds me of that first wall I climbed as a teenager.

So, why do I climb?

I climb for many reasons. Physical motion, mental struggle, because I'm in love and more.
