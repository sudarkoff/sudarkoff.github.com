Tiny Habits® Bootcamp

Do you want to build sustainable habits that lead to transformational changes in your work and life? This virtual 2-week bootcamp is designed to help you master behavior change and learn the skills that will benefit you for life!

My name is George Sudarkoff, and I’m a Certified Tiny Habits® Coach. I have helped hundreds of people to create better habits for their personal and professional lives.
Behavior change is hard! If you’ve ever tried to get rid of that late-night snack habit or start getting up earlier to fit a workout session before work only to fail over and over again—you know what I’m talking about.
But I’m here to tell you—it’s not your fault! Most advice you find about habit creation out there relies too much on motivation. But motivation is inherently unreliable!
Tiny Habits® is a breakthrough behavior change method that does not rely on motivation. It was developed in 2011 by BJ Fogg,  Director of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford, and it’s based on over 20 years of research in human behavior.
BJ’s research demonstrates that there are only three ways to achieve long term behavior change:
have an epiphany—great when it happens, but you can’t create it on command when you need it
change your environment—it works and is a good strategy, but often our environment is outside our control
make tiny changes and wire in new habits in small and incremental ways—the easiest and the most effective strategy—Tiny Habits®!
Who is this for?
If you’ve tried every method of habit creation you could find, if you’ve stuck with your new habits without breaking a streak for 21, 60, or maybe even 90 days, but still couldn’t make those habits stick, if you want to learn how to create sustainable habits without relying on motivation, this is a program for you!
If you are unclear on how to translate your larger life and work goals and aspirations into Tiny Habits, you’ll learn the method for doing just that in this program.
If you’ve been having problems making your habits stick, you’ll learn to troubleshoot and make your habits effortless in this program.
Last but not least, if you are looking for guidance on how to untangle bad habits, you’ll receive it in this program.
