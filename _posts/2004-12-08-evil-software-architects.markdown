I almost entirely agree with David on this subject â€“ Software Architects
shall not abuse their powers! On the other hand, I don't see this
happening often enough to be a real problem. More frequently developers
lack guidance of the knowledgeable architect and thus spend enormous
amount of time integrating their individual pieces written in total
isolation, hacking the system in an effort to add a new "unexpected"
feature, etc. I'd say, the problem is not architects using obscure
language and creating academically sound, but practically unacceptable
architectures, I'd say the problem is lack of experienced Software
Architects, capable of establishing a proper level of communication
within the team.

On the subject of obscure terminology, I strongly believe that a common
language (be it UML, design patterns or even just slang that enough
engineers understand) is a very important component in any engineering
activity. Without it we'll keep waving our hands in the air, desperately
trying to explain simple and obvious ideas. Ideas, that many of us have
implemented numerous times in the past. Besides, "singleton" is so much
shorter and easier to use in the sentence than "a class which is meant
to be instantiated once, and only once" (see
[Wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton)).
