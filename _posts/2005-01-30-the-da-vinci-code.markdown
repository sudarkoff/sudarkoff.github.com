I just finished reading ["The Da Vinci Code" (Dan Brown)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/),
among the last people on this planet, I guess; and I should tell you -
if you are hesitating whether to read it or not - do not hesitate! I
have been enjoying the book for three nights in a row, unable to put it
down. I must confess that I never thought highly of the Christian
Church, or any kind of church for that matter, I believe that true faith
does not need an institution. In fact, some ten years ago I was a member
of a (not so secret) [society](http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_info.html) of
sorts which Russian Orthodox Church despises and considers to be a cult,
no less. But regardless of whether you believe the facts laid out in the
book are accurate, the novel itself is a very well crafted piece of
writing! And a fair amount of controversy makes it even better.
