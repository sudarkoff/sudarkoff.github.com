Yesterday I was running outdoors for the first time since high school. I made a few discoveries:

-   My mouth generates torrents of spit â€“ something that never bothered
    me while I was running exclusively on a treadmill.
-   Despite the common understanding that a treadmill is easier on your
    joints, running on the concrete pavement caused me far less pain in
    joints, I guess the reason being the multiformity. The monotonous
    repetitive nature of a treadmill had been wearing out my joints more
    than a slightly more hazardous but diverse terrain.
-   My legs ached however in ways I had never experienced before. But
    that was a good ache, it means some abandoned muscles are now
    getting their workout as well.
-   I can't tell whether I am running slow enough to last even the
    shortest distance. I need some way of figuring out my pace and
    controlling it.

All in all, I had a great time running outdoors and am planning to do it
more often now (if not always).
