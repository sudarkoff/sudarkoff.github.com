Somebody came to my weblog via Google inquiring "is 6 mph running or jogging"? Why do you care, curious stranger? The difference is only in the word (and a few snobbish runners believing that there is a difference). Some might say that a jogger is the one who doesn't care about the speed. In this sense, since you're asking, 6 mph is definitely running. Have many pleasant miles and stay injury-free â€“ the only thing you **should** care about!
