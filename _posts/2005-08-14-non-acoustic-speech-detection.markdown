A friend of mine [argues (in russian)](http://www.livejournal.com/users/joicy/31535.html?thread=236591#t2365 1), that our thoughts are so sporadic and non-linear that it is going to be hard to concentrate on the topic while "[thinking in](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7247)" (as opposed to "typing in") an article. But I think that even if we're not able to isolate those irrelevant thoughts, they might be very interesting to preserve as some sort of metadata. Imagine how much more useful information we would be able to transmit in an email (if email still exists in ten years) to our distant relatives if we had all those immediate and "irrelevant" distractions recorded!
