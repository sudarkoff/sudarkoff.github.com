Today I was running an improvised 5K race (finished
it in 28:45 minutes) and I noticed that my running cadence was ranging
somewhere between 90 and 95 steps per minute. I thought it
was a bit too frequent (i.e. my stride was too short) and I probably wasted
a lot of energy because of that. But when I came home and researched
this a bit, to my great surprise I've discovered that this is
exactly what they recommend the cadence should be for the best running
economy. Wow! It is nice when something like this comes naturally to
you!
