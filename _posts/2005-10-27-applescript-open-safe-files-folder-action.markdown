\
Continuing the AppleScript theme, here's the script that I wrote to use
as a Folder Action. It automatically opens "safe" files after you
download or copy them to the designated folderâ€”I disabled this feature
in Safari, since my understanding of "safe" is quite different from
Safari's.\

    property safe_types_list : {"org.gnu.gnu-tar-archive", "public.tar-archive","org.gnu.gnu-zip-archive", "org.gnu.gnu-zip-tar-archive","com.apple.binhex-archive", "com.apple.macbinary-archive","public.cpio-archive", "com.pkware.zip-archive","com.allume.stuffit-archive","com.apple.disk-image-udif", "public.iso-image"}on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_itemstell application "Finder"repeat with a_file in added_itemsset UTI to type identifier of (info for a_file)-- display dialog UTI as stringif UTI is in safe_types_list thenopen a_fileend ifend repeatend tellend adding folder items to

\
\
If you'd like this script to handle some additional file types,
un-comment the `display dialog UTI as string` line, drop the file of the
desired type into the folder and the script will display the type
identifier that you need to add to the `safe_types_list` list.\
