I'm playing with Python and I must say I'm impressed by its simplicity
and power! But I have one (theoretical) problem with its
indentation-defines-scope approach. What if (and I stress "if" here) all
my indentation goes south, how am I supposed to know what part of the
code belongs to which scope? As I said, it is strictly theoretical, as I
use source control to store even my perl one-liners. But still,
whitespace being semantically that significant is quite frightening to
me.
