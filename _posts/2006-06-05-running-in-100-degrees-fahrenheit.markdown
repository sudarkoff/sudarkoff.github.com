Last Saturday's long run didn't go very well. By Siberian guy's
standards the weather was absolutely nasty — 100° Fahrenheit and 100%
humid. I only managed to cover 3.7 miles with a couple of hours of
layover in the air-conditioned office in the middle of the workout and
at the embarrassingly pedestrian 11:00/mi. At the corner where I could
have taken a longer route home, the "Steam Machine" by Daft Punk started
playing in my earbuds; I figured that it was as good a sign as I could
get without involving ER and took a shortcut instead. Something tells me
that I will be running in the mornings from now on.

By the way, I noticed that more than 50% of my "power" running playlist
consists of the tunes by The Crystal Method — I wonder if the guys are
endurance sportsmen themselves. With track names like Bound Too Long,
Ready For Action, Tough Guy, Trip Like I Do, Murder, Name Of The Game,
Comin' Back and Starting Over they just have to be.
