I realized something yesterday - I need a running partner or a group. So
I started looking for a running club in and around of Calabasas. Here's
how I figured I need a running buddy.

Yesterday night I headed out for a run. Finally, after a couple of weeks
of hot weather and all my runs taking place on a dreaded treadmill, I
was running outside and was enjoying it immensely. I was running a slow
but steady pace of 9:00"/mi and it felt really great. And as I was
approaching the last half-mile stretch a young fella wearing a hydration
backpack (which pretty much means this was his long run) zoomed by so
fast that I instantly felt like I was walking compared to him.
Naturally, my male ego was hurt and I started catching up with the guy.
When I evened out the pace and glanced at my Forerunner it was showing a
whooping 7:30"/mi pace! And the most amazing part - it didn't feel all
that hard, *it felt awesome*! So, first, I need to re-examine my
training regimen. And second, I need a running partner that will push me
a bit.
