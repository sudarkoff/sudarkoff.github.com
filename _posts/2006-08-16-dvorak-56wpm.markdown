It's been six months since I updated you on my Dvorak typing speed. Presently it is 56 words per minute with the average error rate of 6.4 per cent.

It is slightly slower than 60WPM I had before switching from QWERTY to Dvorak. And the error rate should be well below 5% to consider my typing accurate. So, some might say that it is a failed experiment--not only do I not type 40% faster than I did before the switch, but it is actually even slightly slower and less accurate. Well, to me it's a definite success! First, I didn't get enough practice as I am not a typist and my job functions do not include typing (other than the short cryptic blurbs consisting primarily of all kinds of braces, underscores, ampersands, semicolons, slashes, etc.). But most importantly, my wrists experienced no pain in the last six months, which I think is not a coincedence and a good enough reason to stick with Dvorak.
