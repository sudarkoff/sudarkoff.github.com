I just realized that the majority of people are raging commies and do not even realize it! Every time you hear that something will be good for the community, you hear a commie talking. And it is not necessarily a bad thing. Just like democrats and republicans do not have to be in the opposite camps (they are actually not, they are the same bunch of power and money hungry morons, but that's a different topic altogether).

Perhaps, the world is not black and white!? Perhaps we need a bit of communism in certain things, a bit of liberalism in other things and a lot of conservatism in most other things? The question is always how far to take any particular idea. I like to think of myself as a libertarian, but I laugh at those crazy idealists that think they can do away without any government. Market forces, they say, will sort things out. And I am sure they will - we'll end up having a government. Not necessarily any better one than we have now. So how about we stop dividing ourselves into Democrats and Republicans, whites and blacks, Ruby on Rails-lovers and those enamored with Python?

I expect [Vogons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogons "Vogons") to arrive any minute now.
