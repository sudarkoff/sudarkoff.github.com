The other day, a friend of mine
[complained](http://notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/31150.html) about
Smalltalk being responsible for his increased rent. I responded that to
me Smalltalk always was a little bit like Latin and that although
learning Latin helps in understanding the structure of *other* western
languages, nobody expects you to actually *speak* Latin. (I know it
doesn't make much sense here, so please go read his
[post](http://notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/31150.html).) This lead me
to further thinking about things that are sound in theory but not very
useful in practice. There seems to be some connection between "pure" and
"impractical", don't you think?

In one of my previous posts I
[argued](/completeness_vs_consistency/) that software
systems are essentially incomplete. I thought it was an interesting
argument against obsessing about completeness. But of course in reality
software systems are far from formal (pure). Unlike calculus, software
systems are not necessarily constrained by any formal set of rules of
inference (heuristic and [evolutionary
algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) come to
mind). Same is true about programming languages. In fact, maybe this
"impurity" is precisely why programming languages like C++ are so
useful?
