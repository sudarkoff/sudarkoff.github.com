A few days ago CD turned 25. It's hard to believe that it was around for
that long! I bought my first audio CD in early 90s -- good ten years
after the media debut on August 17, 1982. It was "Morrison Hotel" by The
Doors. I couldn't listen to it for a good couple of months because I
didn't have a player. Then I got a CD ROM drive for my PC. The drive was
insanely expensive and had a feel of something that came from outer
space.

Fast forward fifteen years -- I ripped everything I had to my hard drive
and I listen to it on the iPod. I don't buy music on CDs anymore either.
And finally six months ago, when I was moving from Los Angeles to San
Francisco I gave a few hundred of my audio CDs -- everything I owned --
to a friend of mine. So, RIP CD. It was the glorious 25 years and we
will remember you kindly!
