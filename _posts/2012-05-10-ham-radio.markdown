I got my license ([W6CLB](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3316770)) in August of 2011. My initial motivation was to get a radio for climbing trips and emergency preparedness. But wouldnâ€™t it be cool to also build a Ham Radio Controlled quadcopter that beams Amateur TV down to the ground for scouting climbing routes and whatnot? I think it would!
