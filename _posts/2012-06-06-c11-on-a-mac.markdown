**UPDATE:** Homebrew now has a formula for a fairly recent version of GCC (4.7.0 as of this writing), so the easiest way to install C++11 is by issuing the following commands:

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew install gcc --enable-cxx --enable-fortran --use-llvm

But if you’re interesting in installing the compiler(s) manually, keep reading.

* * * * *

gcc 4.7 implements [most of the C++11 features](http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html). This article outlines the steps required for installing the compiler on a Mac. I chose to install it in a separate folder so I could continue using the previously installed copy of gcc.

Before proceeding, make sure that Xcode is installed and that your PATH, INCLUDE\_PATH, LIBPATH and other related environment variables don’t have anything funny in them. Then download and untar: [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html), [gmp](http://gmplib.org/), [mpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/) and [mpc](http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=download). Finally, build everything in the following order:

Build and install gmp in the /usr/local/gcc-4.7 directory:

    cd gmp-5.0.5/
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.7
    make
    sudo make install

Then, build and install mpfr:

    cd ../../mpfr-3.1.0/
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.7
    make
    sudo make install

Then, build and install the last prerequisite - mpc:

    cd ../../mpc-0.9/
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --with-mpfr=/usr/local/gcc-4.7
    make
    sudo make install

Finally, build and install gcc 4.7:

    cd ../../gcc-4.7.0/
    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --enable-checking=release --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --with-mpfr=/usr/local/gcc-4.7 --with-mpc=/usr/local/gcc-4.7
    make -j 4 # NB! 4 represents the number of cores on my computer, adjust to your environment
    sudo make install

Now, you can create symlinks to the newly installed binaries. The absolute minimum that we’ll get you going is:

    ln -s /usr/local/gcc-4.7/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/gcc
    ln -s /usr/local/gcc-4.7/bin/g++ /usr/local/bin/g++

Alternatively, you can create symlinks for everything:

    # binaries
    for f in /usr/local/gcc-4.7/bin/*; do ln -s $f /usr/local/bin/`basename $f`; done
    # include files
    for f in /usr/local/gcc-4.7/include/*; do ln -s $f /usr/local/include/`basename $f`; done
    # libraries
    for f in /usr/local/gcc-4.7/lib/pkgconfig/*; do ln -s $f /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/`basename $f`; done
    for f in /usr/local/gcc-4.7/lib/*; do ln -s $f /usr/local/lib/`basename $f`; done
