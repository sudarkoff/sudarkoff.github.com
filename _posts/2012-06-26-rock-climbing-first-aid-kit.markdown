**Disclaimer:** *I’m not a doctor, yadda-yadda-yadda. Simply having
a first-aid kit in your pack is neither going to keep you safe, nor
magically save somebody’s life if you have no idea how to use it. If you
climb outdoors, do yourself a favor and take a Wilderness First Aid or a
similar class.*

First of all, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training
and for the environment you’re going to find yourself in. If you’re not
qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there’s no need to bring the
implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a
problem on an ice climbing trip.

Second, rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall and
therefore I am only going to focus on traumatic injuries. I would
recommend taking a Wilderness First Aid class if you want to learn more
about non-traumatic injuries - they are not obvious to diagnose and
treat.

The things that can go wrong in a fall include spinal injuries, head
trauma, bone fractures, muscle and tendon tears, skin lacerations, joint
dislocations, sprains, abrasions, burns, blisters, and so on. If all
this makes you dizzy - either stay at home or find a friend willing to
save your ass if it comes to it.

Spinal and head injuries require rapid evacuation and there’s very
little you can do to help your patient - backboards and head
immobilization devices are bulky and therefore you’re unlikely to carry
them with you on a climbing trip. Compound fractures, deep lacerations
and crush wounds also require immediate evacuation. However, you should
be able to stop the bleeding, dress the wounds and splint an injured
limb before the help arrives. Some joint dislocations could be reduced
in the field (e.g.: shoulder or finger), other would require qualified
help and in some cases specialized equipment - immobilize with a splint
and evacuate. Finally, sprains, abrasions, rope burns and flappers could
be treated in the field with a few simple supplies.

Here’s an approximate list of items for a *climbing-specific first aid
kit*:

-   Non-latex surgical gloves
-   Assortment of sterile wound dressings, bandages and gauzes
-   Triangular bandages with a few safety pins
-   Universal aluminum splint (SAM or wire mesh)
-   Assortment of bandaids
-   Blister treatment
-   Alcohol wipes
-   Antibiotic ointment
-   Adhesive tape
-   Pain killers
-   Tweezers
-   Ice pack
-   Heat pad
-   Mylar rescue blanket
-   Notepad and pencil
