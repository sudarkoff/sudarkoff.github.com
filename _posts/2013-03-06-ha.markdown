I was always intrigued by the idea of automating the routine parts of my life. Over the years, I looked at different technologies and approaches, but I couldn’t find the approach that would be both simple and cheap and open to tinkering. Finally, thanks to a colleague, I discovered [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) - an awesome platform supplemented by a lively community of makers. I've built quite a few Arduino-compatible devices and some of them are still chugging away.

More recently, I came a cross a [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com/) platform and so the bulk of my HA setup nowadays is based on ST. Although my own devices are still playing an active role.

## Attic Fan Thermostat

This is my first big project related to Home Automation. The [Thermostat](https://github.com/sudarkoff/thermostat) is Arduino-compatible and I built "from scratch" - design the schematics, PCB and the case. 

I built it in 2011 and it has been controlling my attic fans without any glitches or even a single reboot ever since. The schematic is extremely simple: it's just an ATMEGA328 microprocessor, a 5V voltage regulator, a few connections for digital sensors - temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure - and a dry relay for switching a load. The thermostat can work either completely autonomously - monitor (and broadcast, if an optional ZigBee radio is connected) sensor readings and control the fan based on the hard-coded threshold. Alternatively, it can be controlled by a home automation system wirelessly. Theoretically, SmartThings could control the thermostat, but unfortunately the ZigBee radio I have connected to the thermostat right now is not 100% compatible with SmartThings.

## Garage Parking Assistant

The [Garage Parking Assistant](https://github.com/sudarkoff/garageparkingsensor) serves the dual purpose: (1) it helps to park a perfect distance from the wall and (2) it feed the car presence data to the home automation system via the ZigBee wireless mesh network.

### Weather Station (TODO)

The goal is to build a complete weather station from scratch - mechanics, electronics and software. The station should be completely solar powered, should communicate with the home automation system via the ZigBee wireless mesh network and should include the following sensors:

-   Temperature
-   Relative Humidity
-   Barometric Pressure
-   Light Sensor
-   Anemometer
-   Wind Vane
-   Rain Gauge

Optionally, it might include sensors for reading air quality, detecting certain pollutant, radiation, etc. Naturally, because the plan is to power it with a solar panel, the power consumption will limit what sensor will be practical to include in the final design.
