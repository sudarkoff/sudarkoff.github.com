One of the things I wish I could go back in time and tell my 20-year old self is that life doesn't have a destination. In the grand scheme of things nothing you do is either significant or important. But what you do or care for right this moment gives meaning to your own life. So if you're not doing or caring for anything, then your life has no meaning. And meaningless life is an unhappy life. So get off your butt and do something you care for, I'd tell myself. And if you do that, you'll be happy and people around you will be happy as well. Pretty simple stuff.
