I can't believe I am doing it! But after playing with git for a couple of weeks (including using it on top of Perforce at work) I am converting all my svn repositories to git. It is a completely different experience. It takes some getting used to, but when you finally do, it's like finding Jesus. The feeling is very similar to what I experienced after switching to Mac. The stuff just works!
