## Thermostat

[Thermostat](https://github.com/sudarkoff/thermostat) was my 1st Arduino-compatible project. I built it in 2011 and it has been controlling my attic fans without glitches or even a single reboot ever since. The schematic is extremely simple: it's just an ATMEGA328 microprocessor, a 5V voltage regulator, a few connections for digital sensors (like ambient temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure), and a relay for switching the load.
