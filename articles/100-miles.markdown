Today I reached a 100 mile mark since the beginning of the year. This is
roughly 30 miles per month or 8 miles per week - almost three times
fewer than I planned. But it still feels good. I don't remember who said
it: "I am not running to add days to my life, but to add life to my
days." And this is exactly how it feels!
