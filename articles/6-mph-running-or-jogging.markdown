Yesterday at 2:30 AM as I was setting the alarm-clock before going to
bed I thought to myself - they say a grown man should sleep eight hours
a day, but shouldn't you also count the time that passes between the
moment you go to bed and the moment you actually fall asleep? And is
there a distinct moment when one crosses the line between being awake
and being asleep?\

Anyway, this is not why I am writing this post. Somebody came to my
weblog via Google inquiring "is 6 mph running or jogging"? Why do you
care, curious stranger? The difference is only in the word (and a few
snobbish runners believing that there is a difference). Some might say
that a jogger is the one who doesn't care about the speed. In this
sense, since you're asking, 6 mph is definitely running. Have many
pleasant miles and stay injury-free â€“ the only thing you **should** care
about!\
