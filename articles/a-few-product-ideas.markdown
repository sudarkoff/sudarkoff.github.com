As I was indulging myself in almost an hour of
[running](/running/entry/75) today, I [thought to
myself](/archives/2005/07/26/innovation.html)—"why, oh why there's
no…"—and then I had three loosely joined thoughts came to my mind at the
same time:\

\
1. First of all, I want a lightweight (so I could run with it)
bluetooth-enabled stereo headset (with microphone) that I could program
to respond to a few devices at the time. For example, if my phone rings,
pause the music that I might be listening to at that time and let me
answer the call. Or, if my wearable fitness-oriented GPS announces some
information like my current pace or mileage—lower the volume of the
music, let the announcement through.\

\
2. All (well, many) laptops should have rotating and touch-sensitive
screens. I won't buy it *instead* of a true tablet as the latter should
be small and lightweight, but the rotating screen on a regular laptop
would prove useful in many situations, even if not touch-sensitive.\

\
3. The last, but probably the most missed by me right now is the
Serial-2-Bluetooth adapter. I won't even elaborate on this idea as all
those ancient devices laying around in their own puke of wires and
cables speak for themselves.\

**Update:**Scratch that last one as I have
[found](http://www.socketcom.com/product/CS0400-479.asp) what I needed!\
