Title: A little bad poetry

As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of
my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when
nineteen). I've tried my hand at translating a couple of them into
English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack
of ability to express myself in a foreign landuage), so I took it as a
challenge, and attempted a translation of the shortest and least rhymed
one. Here's the result:

        Your face is a ripe peach
        On it rottenness has no place
        Very, very boring face...

It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it's better rhymed now :-)
