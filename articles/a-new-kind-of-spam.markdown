A new kind of spam stroke my website yesterday -- a wiki-spam. ACL
doesn't help very much (although I am making everything I can unmutable
right now), because it forces a more restrictive setup which goes
against the very idea of Wiki - anyone can modify pages. So far the
assumption was that "anyone" includes only humans and that it is much
easier to restore the site's content than to destroy it. Spam-bots just
entered the picture and it changes everything!
