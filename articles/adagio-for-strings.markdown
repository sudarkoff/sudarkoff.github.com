For all of you fellow suckers for powerful adagios, I give you fifteen
minutes of Serenity (well, sort of). First goes the original piece
written by [Samuel Barber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Barber)
and then it's adaptation by
[TiÃ«sto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Tiesto). And don't tell me you
didn't like [it](/audio/20051109_adagio_for_strings.m4a)!\
