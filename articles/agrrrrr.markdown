How many factual errors could you spot in the following excerpt:\

> \
> Your temporary 6 digit PIN has been set to your Date of Birth (MMDDY);
> for example, if your DOB is February 6, 1964, your PIN will be
> 020564.\

\
And although you might think that despite the number of errors in this
instruction the correct way of composing the PIN is still quite obvious,
let me assure you it is not true. Apparently, they made another error
while implementing all this:\

> \
> **Error: Invalid Login Attempt, Please Try Again...**\

\
And so I tried a few more times and after five unsuccessfull logins, my
account was blocked and I had to call Help Desk, submit the ticket and
wait. Agrrrrr...\
