Thanks to [Mark Pilgram](http://diveintomark.org), I now have [Atom
feed](/george/atom.xml) for my weblog. Of course, it doesn't mean I'll
have time to write more aften...

And yes, there are only two news aggregators
([NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) and
[BottomFeeder](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/BottomFeeder/)) that
support this new format, but I am sure more will come pretty soon.
