This is a good example of the bad grouping of page elements. Neither of
the text blocks clearly "claims" the illustration. Vertical whitespace
below the upper text block suggest that the illustration belongs to the
block below it. But the header of the second text block separates it
from the picture. It would have been much better to place the header
above the image and the rest of the text below it.
