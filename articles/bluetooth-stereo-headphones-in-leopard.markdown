For me, one of the nice features in Leopard is the support for Bluetooth
stereo headphones (A2DP).\
As much as I love the simplicity and reliability of the basic iPod ear\
bugs, you just can't beat the feeling of freedom that wireless\
headphones give you!\

\
I am using Motorola HT820 headphones. They are not the most comfortable\
headphones (I have a truckload of headphones of all shapes and price\
points in my possession and I find iPod ear buds to be most\
comfortable for prolonged usage), but the sound quality is quite
acceptable for anything\
from talking on the phone to listening to music. Play/Pause, Skip,
Rewind and Volume buttons are also supported.\
