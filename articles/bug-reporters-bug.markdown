As I was trying to report the bug that was bugging me for a month or
so...

\

**Update:** The bug that I was trying to file—turnes out—is actually a
[Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) bug (I am using version
ß42). If I have it running (which I normaly do, since I really can't
imagine my life without it), drag-n-drop in Finder and on the Desktop
stops working after a few minutes of running Quicksilver.
