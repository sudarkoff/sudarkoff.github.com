I like this idea a lot. Coming from a country with a well-developed
public transportation system and [subways which look like
museums](http://www.metro.ru/stations/arbatsko-pokrovskaya/arbatskaya/),
I hate wasting almost two hours of my valuable time in terrible commute
every day. I would be much happier if I could just jump on a train and
spend even twice as much time *reading some interesting book*.
