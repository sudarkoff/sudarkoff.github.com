You must've noticed by now that I haven't been writing here lately, and
the reason is that I am too busy designing a new big thing at work. I'm
beginning to hate these all-day meetings, but it looks like we are
finally closing to something people could start coding from. I was still
able to read some news during short coffee breaks between meetings, and
here's what I came across during the last few days.

[Vertigo...Then and
Now](http://www.basichip.com/vertigo/main.htm "Vertigo...Then and Now")
Although I don't remember watching this movie, it was still interesting
to see how San Francisco has not changed since the late ~~sixties~~
fifties.
