I just glanced at my [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/) statistics and
noticed that my readership shrunk by 75 per cent! "What is going on?!" â€“
I thought to myself, when it occurred to me that I forgot to setup
redirects for my older feed URL's when switching the hosting a couple of
weeks ago. That's how you learn that people still use those "obsolete"
URL's in their feed-readers. That's fine with me, I'll just have to
remember about this bit next time I switch hosting (which I hope won't
happen again any time soon). Anyway, it all should be working fine now.\
