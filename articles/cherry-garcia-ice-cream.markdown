​I made this recipe a number of times and the results are always
excellent!

**Prep Time**: 15 minutes \
**Total Time**: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

-   2 eggs
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   2 cups heavy cream
-   1 cup whole milk
-   1/2 cup crushed dark chocolate
-   1/2 cup fresh cherries

### Directions

-   Place the crushed chocolate (tiny solid chunks taste better than
    shaved flakes which tend to soften or even dissolve) and the pitted
    and halved cherries (you can use canned cherries, but make sure to
    drain and dry them first) in separate bowls and refrigerate for a
    few hours.

-   Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2
    minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue
    whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the
    cream and milk and whisk to blend.

-   Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and stir until almost
    ready.

-   About 5 minutes before the ice cream is ready, add the chocolate and
    the cherries, then continue stirring until the ice cream becomes
    stiff.

-   Transfer into a storage container and place in the freezer for a few
    hours.

### Yield

This recipe make just over **1 quart** of delicious ice cream depending
on the size of the eggs and the amount of chocolate and cherries. I
always get too greedy with the fillings, but can you blame me?
