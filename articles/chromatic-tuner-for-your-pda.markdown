I remember the times when to have a real-time chromatic tuner running on
your personal computer did not seem feasible. But these days everything
is possible!..

Phonature's
[PhonTuner](http://www.handango.com/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?productId=78870)
is an impressive application. It has a slick streamlined interface and
an astonishing set of features that would bring any regilar
thirty-dollar tuner to shame. It is one of those applications that add
another reason to own a PDA! (Спасибо,
