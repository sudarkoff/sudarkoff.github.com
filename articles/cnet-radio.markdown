Ever since CNet Radio stopped airing in the Bay Area I've been looking
for alternatives. CNet Radio Direct sounded like a good one at first,
but as it turned out I was too lazy to burn a CD every day in order to
listen to it in my car. XM Radio? Well, I still cannot accept the idea
of paying for listening to the *radio*. Any other alternatives out
there?
