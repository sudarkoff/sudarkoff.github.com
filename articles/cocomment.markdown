[coComment](http://cocomment.com/ "coComment: Collect, organize and share your internet conversations")
is great, but I was thinking (a couple of months ago, actually) -- why
not just implement a simple ping thingy for comments? You post a comment
on somebody's weblog/website, you leave a url (perhaps it's your
[OpenID](http://openid.net/) URL) and the weblog pings you back every
time a new comment is posted in that thread. Simple, decentralized and
doesn't require any new code to be written other than to put a few
existing things together.
