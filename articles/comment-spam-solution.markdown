Title: Comment spam solution

Ever since I installed
[mt-spamassassin](http://www.kahunaburger.com/blog/archives/000189.html "Movable Type plugin: Spamassassin")
and
[mt-proxyplug](http://www.kahunaburger.com/blog/archives/000192.html "Movable Type plugin: Proxyplug")
plugins a few days ago my comment spam problem dissolved into oblivion.
Proxyplug alone catches 99.9% of all spam. The only thing that is
missing there is the button to feed a comment to sa-learn (I had one
false negative that I had to copy-n-paste to a file and sa-learn it
manually). Otherwise I highly recommend both plugins!
