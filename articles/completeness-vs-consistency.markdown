Title: Completeness vs. consistency

In the early days of my programming career I was obsessed with
completeness of the API's I was constructing. Of course, over the years
I learned better, than to waste my time. But I still couldn't construct
a clear cut argument against complete API's. Aside from the time
constraint issues, "complete" certainly sounds better, than
"incomplete". That is before I read the [Gödel's
Proof](http://www.amazon.com/Godels-Proof-Ernest-Nagel/dp/0814758169 "Gödel's Proof").
The fog has cleared (but my math is still rusty at best, so I could be
blowing smoke, for all I know). Clearly (please do correct me if I am
wrong), any given software system is a formal axiomatic system and as
such, it is essentially incomplete. So there we go, from now on I don't
feel guilty concentrating my efforts on consistency instead of
completeness.
