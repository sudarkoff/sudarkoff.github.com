The following is funny, no doubt:

But sure our clients know what they want, we just can't transfer that
knowledge from their heads to ours in a form that is immediately
consumable. There's only that much you can convey with words, boxes and
arrows. The knowledge in its purest form just has to evolve over time.
That's why constant communication is important â€” it is a transport for
knowledge. (And that's why outsourced teams are at an inherent
disadvantage.)
