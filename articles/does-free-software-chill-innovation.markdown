First of all, I disagree that there is such expectation.\

\
Better alternatives always have and always will cost something (money,
time, effort, ease of use, compatibility, peace of mind, whatever).
People choose free apps (1) because they have extra time/energy to make
and keep the stuff working, (2) because they can't afford that beast
trying to solve all problems at once, (3) because they are pissed at bad
service/support they paid for when using commercial app, etc. If I, for
one, find a certain app to be better than its free alternative (and if
it's priced reasonably)â€”I buy it. Also, "free" *is* a price. Make your
stuff better and you won't have to compete with "free".\

\
And if there is an expectation that certain types of software ought to
be free, then maybe it's a good thing? Maybe those types of software
enable something important and that's why we expect it to be free?\
