Dr. Dobb's is now available in digital format to their paid subscribers.
You can either read an issue online, use their offline reader (Windows
only?) or download a zipped pdf. A pdf sounded gread so I gladly
proceeded to downloading it ... only to find the first 27 pages missing.
I would like to believe that it's just a glitch and they will fix it
soon to avoid pissing off more people. Luckily, their online app allows
you to print out the whole thing (albeit with poorer quality). And of
course printing to pdf is a snap on a Mac.
