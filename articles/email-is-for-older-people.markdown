I hate to admit it, but I am with U.S. teenagers on this oneâ€”[email is
for older
people](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=581&e=2&u=/nm/20050727/tc_nm/tech_teens_dc).
I find myself using IM almost exclusively when communicating with
friends (although, I wish there was more interoperability in this area)
and I use email mostly for work-related communications and to talk to my
parents. I also use a simple perl script to feed my email subscriptions
(yeah, those are still around) into my feed reader.\
