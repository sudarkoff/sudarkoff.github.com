\
Next Wednesday, 1/12/05, beginning at 8PM GMT-8 and concluding at 4AM
GMT-8 on Thursday, 1/13/05, our mail server will be transitioned to a
new data center.\

\
You may experience a brief interruption in your email services during
the maintenance window, and any email sent during the previous 24 hours
will be unavailable for the duration of the maintenance. You will have
access to all email older than 24 hours and any new email received after
the maintenance commences will be available by 9PM GMT-8.\

\
Our mail server will continue to accept email and no email will be lost
during this transition.\
