The USA and Israel are presenting inaugural conference on [Cooperation
for Energy Independence of
Democracies](http://www.energycooperation.org/).\
\

> "Dependency on uncertain and interruptible energy supplies from Middle
> Eastern states is a crucial strategic issue that must be resolved to
> assure the long-term security of Israel, the United States and the
> world's other democracies. The importation of these critical fossil
> fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) is vulnerable to economic as well as
> physical attack. The world's democracies spend billions of dollars
> each year trying to protect access to these resources. In addition,
> the petrodollars that the suppliers receive often end up being used
> for purposes inimical to the interests of the world's democracies;
> these funds are used to purchase weapons, to support the spread of
> radical Islamicist thought, and to finance the spread of terrorism.
> For all of these reasons, reducing dependency on fossil fuels is a
> critical and timely challenge for the world's democracies."
