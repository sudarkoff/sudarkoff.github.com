While listening to Jerry Fiddler on ITConversations I thought: The real
world evolves by implementing millions of changes at a time and then
seeing which ones survive. This is almost the opposite of what we think
of evolution in software development. Is there a value in adopting the
real-life approach to software and how do we do it?\
