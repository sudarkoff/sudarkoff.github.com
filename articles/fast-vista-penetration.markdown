Title: Fast Vista penetration

It just hit me -- fast adoption of Vista by Windows users is probably a
good thing for the Mac market share (and Linux as a cheaper alternative,
of course). I know it sounds ridiculous, but listen to me for a second.
A whole bunch of folks will upgrade either by purchasing a new PC with
Vista pre-installed or worse yet by buying the ridiculously overpriced
upgrade and installing it on their outdated hardware. And the stuff will
break: microphones will stop working, printers will stop printing, apps
will start crashing, annoying dialog boxes will start popping up
everywhere, etc... and suddenly the prospect of switching to a
completely different OS all their geekier friends can't stop raving
about will become less scary! What do you think?
