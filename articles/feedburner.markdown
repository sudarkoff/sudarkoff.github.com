Title: FeedBurner

Looking at the Apache stats and realizing that nearly 100% of my regular
readers never visit my website, and thus those statistics that I collect
through [SiteMeter](http://www.sitemeter.com) are just useless, I gave
in! Now all three of my weblog's feeds (that is **not** including
[Running Log](/running/atom),
[Flickr.com](http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=15178141@N00&format=atom_03)
and [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/rss/sudarkoff) feeds) are going
through the [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com).

\

I hope I configured my rewrite rules correctly, in which case you don't
need to do anything. If, on the other hand, you're reading this in the
browser, but do not see the same article in your feedreader, that means
I screwed up somewhere. In which case, please update your
feedreader/podcatcher to point to
[http://feeds.feedburner.com/sudarkoff](http://feeds.feedburner.com/sudarkoff).
