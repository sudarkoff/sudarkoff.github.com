Title: FileVault is not good

If you're thinking about enabling FileVault feature of the Mac OS X to
secure the data on your laptop - don't. Instead, create an encrypted
disk image and store your important files there. I had been using
FileVault for over a year and my experience was rapidly deteriorating
lately. Even though FileVault never caused any disasters or a loss of my
data, I decided to turn it off a couple of weeks ago and my life is
better already! My good old G4 PowerBook is significantly more
responsive, it wakes up instantly and reliably (no more looking at the
spinning rainbow of death), certain apps no longer "forget" that they
are default providers of their services, etc. So, use encrypted disk
image to store your important files, don't use FileVault. (And backup
your data regularly, but more about this later.)
