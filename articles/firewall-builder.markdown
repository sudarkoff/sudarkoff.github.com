[Firewall Builder](http://www.fwbuilder.org) is featured in May issue of
the Linux Journal. It's interesting how often things that are right
under your very nose are passing by unnoticed. A couple of my friends,
Vadim Kurland and [Vadim
Zaliva](http://www.livejournal.com/users/vzaliva/), have been working on
this tool for ages and I even remember Vadim Zaliva recommending it to
me when I was having problems setting up my firewall properly (yes, I am
a networks dummy). At the time I had a very old version of RedHat on my
server, so I failed to install it. Later, I upgraded to RedHat 8.0 but
somehow, I forgot about this wonderful program, and to add Wi-Fi segment
to my home network I again had to go though the settings manually - it
was such a pain!

So I guess, now that they have beenÂ mentioned in the press twice (first
time in some German [Linux
Magazin](http://www.linux-magazin.de/Artikel/ausgabe/2001/06/firewall/Firewall-GUI.html)
in 2001), it's about time I gave Firewall Builder a try. :-)
