I finally came around to selling the unused portions of my gadgetry.
First of all to get rid of the stuff that I, well, don't use but that
could happily satisfy someone else's needs. And then to make some money
towards my next toy - WiFi-enabled Pocket PC phone.
[Here's](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5768712127)
the first auction. Also, coming down the pipe are CLIÃ‰ UX50 PDA, VAIO
FXA63 laptop and more. Stay tuned.\
