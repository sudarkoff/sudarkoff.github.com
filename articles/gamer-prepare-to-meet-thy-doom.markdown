I haven't been playing computer games ever since I stopped working on
the game engine for some crazy guy from Los Angeles. That whould be four
years already. And frankly, I don't like playing computer games too
much. At least those not involving software engineering. :-)

But this one - WOW! You should see the screenshots for yourself, it is
really something! I guess I'll try it just to enjoy the high quality
graphics (and maybe some action too).
