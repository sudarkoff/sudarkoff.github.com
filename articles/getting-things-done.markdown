As I am reading [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/)'s "[Getting
Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/)" book, I am
realizing that a lot of what he suggests I am already doing. I even have
a couple of drawers with unmarked hangers and labeled files in them. The
only missing thing now is actually **getting things done**! Oh, well...\
