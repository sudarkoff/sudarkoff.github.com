How cool would it be if Google Maps were able to produce driving
directions suitable for cyclists! It would use only safe streets,
streets with bike lanes or bike trails, when possible. The directions
would also include elevation information, so that cyclists could avoid
hard hills, etc. This would be a fantastic tool and would most
definitely encourage more people to choose bikes over cars for their
daily commute.
