Google is about to introduce Spreadsheets: [Google Spreadsheets - Sneak
Peek](http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html "Google Spreadsheets - Sneak Peek").

That's all great, guys, and I hear people even go as far as to say that
combined with [Writely](http://writely.com) it renders MS Office
obsolete. But personally I am not so optimistic. How do you work/access
your documents in the offline mode which happens oh so often at the
times when you need those documents the most? We need some kind of
hybrid to really solve the problem. And I wonder who is going to be the
first to implement a sensible solution combining the best of both
worlds. Microsoft?
