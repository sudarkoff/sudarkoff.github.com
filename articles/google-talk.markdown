Title: Google Talk

I kinda always wanted to get rid of a bunch of extraneous IM accounts I
have hanging around in my IM client (Adium, by the way, is the best
multiprotocol IM client for Mac in my opinion) and leave just a couple
of them I use the most. The problem with this, of course, is that I have
contacts in all networks and I would hate to lose them. For a while I
tried to convince my ICQ and MSN people to switch to other networks. As
ICQ's old protocol, for example, is badly supported, doesn't handle
Unicode very well and overall is not the most pleasant to deal with --
whose idea was to use strings of arbitrary numbers for screen names!?
But you know how it goes -- if there's no obvious reason (other than me
whining), then there's no reason.

\

But now that I can't use anything but Google Talk at work (for various
reasons), I finally made the leap. So, if you want to talk to me, please
consider downloading and installing Google Talk or configuring your
favorite multinetwork IM client accordingly. In GTalk world your screen
name is your GMail email address, so you'll know how to find me.
Otherwise leave a comment in this entry and I'll get back to you.

Hopefully, Google will implement the server-to-server part of the Jabber
protocol soon and so we'll be able to use gateways to connect to other
networks as I still would love to be able to talk to Yahoo! IM people,
but until then I urge you to try Google Talk. And see you on GTalk!
