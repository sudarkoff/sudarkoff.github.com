In over eight years of code-writing, yesterday was the first time I used
"goto" to skip the part of the cycle. Not that I am proud or
something... I am just so awefully tired, feel like I am going to
collapse in the middle of the next if-statement...

By the way, a couple of days ago I got my new Clie UX50 in the mail (to
keep me running :-)). Expect a few words of excitement here and the
whole bunch of pictures on my moblog.
