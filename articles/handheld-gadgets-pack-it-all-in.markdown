I share this point of view for the most part - I really don't like bulky
cell phones as
[Treo](http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/gprs.jhtml) and
the likes; it feels weird holding such a [wall
brick](http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm) to
your ear while talking. I like my
[T68i](http://www.sonyericsson.com/T68i/) a lot. It's a great cell phone
indeed, with all the right features: GSM, Bluetooth, GPRS, etc, - but...

But with a [Bluetooth-enabled
PDA](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start;sid=N6rZ-x4GNCbZ2yCoMeHT8FEX66Llut6QiGs=?Dept=hp&CatalogCategoryID=nBIKC0%2eN_h0AAAD05dQNJMQy)
and [a wireless
hands-free](/george/archives/2003/03/14/jabra_freespeak.html) I hardly
take my T68i out of the
[case](http://www.vajacases.com/Vaja/catalogo.nsf/ProdsPadrelkp/609x_SonyEricsson/$file/609Grande.jpg)
at all. So, do I really need a cell phone as a separate device?!
