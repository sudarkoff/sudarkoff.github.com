Title: Having more things means losing more things

I’ve been doing this thing for a while - stashing multiple quantities of
things I need or want to have handy at different times and in different
locations - and I am happy to report that it’s not only wasteful, but it
also doesn’t work. It sorta works for things like power bricks that are
semi-permanently attached to a place (e.g.: you sit on a couch and there
is a power cord for your laptop there.) But it doesn’t work for things
like eye glasses, notebooks and headphones. They either slowly all end
up in the same place or just get lost one by one - having more things
means losing more things.

I remember a tale I’ve heard as a child. It was about an ancient ruler
who decorated his worrier’s swards and shields with precious stones so
they wouldn’t lose them and leave them behind fleeing a battle field.
And that’s similar to the new approach I’m testing - acquiring the best
pair of eye glasses money can buy and hanging tight to them. This, I
noticed, creates a deeper emotional attachment to a thing so I end up
carrying it around and caring about it more. And I hope it leads to a
less cluttered life - the proverbial “less is more.”
