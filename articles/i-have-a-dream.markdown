Title: I have a dream

My sweetest dream for the last few years (of a technological kind, at
least) was to have a full-blown home automation system. I want to be
able to check my email, read news, program a DVR, AC or coffeemaker, and
to control a security system, lights, music, etc. from any room in the
house. And I want things happening automagically without me wasting my
precious time. *I want technology to deliver on its decades-old promises
already!*

Although this all sounds quite feasible there is one big "but" if you
consider implementing it with the current state of things. To administer
the system of this complexity will be a full-time job. And to become a
servant of my own home automation system would be the biggest joke of
all times!
