In my iTunes library—in the "Absolute Best" category—I have stuff like
Squirrel Nut Zippers, Britney Spears, Saskia Laroo, Björk, Cake,
Madonna, Linkin Park, Gwen Stefani, King Crimson, Shania Twain, Cesaria
Evora, Tom Waits, FatBoy Slim and god knows what else. How does it make
me feel? Pretty freaking great!\

That is not to say I don't know what Tim is talking about—I used to feel
the embarrassment myself. But not anymore!\

That's pretty much how it is with me and my music. It took me a couple
of months before I figured out that the song I like running to so much
is the "Name of the Game" by "The Crystal Method". And that's about all
I know about that song (and also that it's about 90 BPM, since that
happens to be the perfect stride cadence for running).\
