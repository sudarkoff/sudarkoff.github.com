Never run when you have even slightest symptoms of the cold heading your
way. Running is good for your health in the long run, but the immediate
effect is a breach in your immune system for a few hours following the
workout. Yesterday I neglected this simple rule and now I am having a
scratchy throat, a running nose and everything else that accompanies the
cold. Stupid!\
