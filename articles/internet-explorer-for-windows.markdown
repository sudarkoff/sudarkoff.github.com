Some of you have probably noticed that my website does not look pretty
in the Internet Explorer for Windows. A pity but it is probably going to
stay this way for a while. Although I am not one of those guys trashing
IE on every occasion, urging everyone to switch to
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) (though, [you
probably
should](http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3374931)
anyway), and I'd really love my site to look equally good in all
browsers, the reality is - I don't have neither the time nor the skills
to make it work in every single browser out there and I have better and
more important things to do. Besides, IE for Windows is the only
problematic browser at the moment. So, hereby I extend my apologies to
all 1.07% of my readers who use IE!\
