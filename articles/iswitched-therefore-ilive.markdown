So, I [switched](http://www.apple.com/switch/ "Why switch to a Mac?").
From the world where every suit you buy almost fits as is and doesn't
cost too much, but you have to buy a new one every month because it
wears out and its pockets are full of crap and you don't know where it
came from, to a world where you can get a suit for free but it doesn't
quite fit, it's ugly and you have to sew your own sleeves to it, and
finally to a world where you just buy the suit and you wear it, and it
*feels good* - my journey was long and painful, but now it's over and I
love where I am ended.\
