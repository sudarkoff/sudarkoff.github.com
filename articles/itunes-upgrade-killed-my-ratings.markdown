iTunes 5.0 upgrade failed to import my music library and so all play
counts and ratings which basically drove more than twenty smart
playlists in my library are gone. Thankfully, I have a pretty recent
backup handy. The only problem is—I don't know what to do with it
because import keeps failing no matter how many times I try. And the
error message is unsuggestive…
