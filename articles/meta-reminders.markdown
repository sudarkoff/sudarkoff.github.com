My wife surprised me with some productivity innovation today. A few minutes ago an alarm on her cell phone went off. When I asked her what it was about she told me that it's a meta-reminder. A couple of hours ago she remembered that she had to remember to do something in the evening and so she set up an alarm without actually remembering what exactly she was supposed to do. Of course, the problem is, she still could not remember it when the alarm went off, so it's really not a very effective innovation, but still it's quite funny.
