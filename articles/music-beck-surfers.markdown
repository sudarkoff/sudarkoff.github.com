I was going through my 60+ Gig library of mp3's in search of something
"fresh" to listen to, and a few minutes ago I accidently played Surfers'
"Pepper" right after Beck's "Loser." On about 10th second of the song I
realized that I had already heard these riffs. I was listening and I
couldn't believe my ears - how could it be?!?! Then I spent a few
minutes researching the matter, and here's what I found:

This song is ["... a cross pollination between Beck's "Loser" and Jim
Carroll's "People Who
Died.""](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/butthole-surfers/electriclarryland.shtml)
Thank God I am not crazy and it really does sound similar!
