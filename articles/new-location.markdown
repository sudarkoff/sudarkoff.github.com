I've decided to move my blog to this [new
location](http://george.sudarkoff.com "What I Write Is What I See") for
two reasons: (1) to give [Movable
Type](http://movabletype.org "Movable Type") a try and (2) to separate
family news from my personal blog. I've seen [Chris
Pirillo](http://chris.pirillo.com "Chris Pirillo ~ Getting Screwed While Everybody Else is Getting Laid")
[do this](http://pirillo.com "pirillo.com") succesfully and I thought
that this scheema would fit my situation as well.

\

I'll try to invest more effort in our [family
site](http://sudarkoff.com "Sudarkoffs' Virtual Home"); and I'll do it
mostly in Russian because 90 per cent of our readers are our friends and
relatives from Russia. I don't think I will have enough time to
translate everything into English though. Unless my wife is willing to
help. ;)

...Why on Earth am I writing in English? Good question!.. Short answer:
I don't know. Sure, English is the language I'm still learning, but so
is Russian :)... Probably, writing in English switches something in my
head. For some strange reason I cannot blog in Russian. For me it's like
swearing in French... Or maybe I just want to be heard by a bigger
crowd?
