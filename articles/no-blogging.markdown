Title: No blogging

I had been quiet for the last couple of months. There are couple of
reasons for that. First, about seven weeks ago I accepted a position of
a Member of Technical Staff with VMware and moved back to Silicon Valley
-- these past couple of months were quite busy. Second, I cannot find a
good unobtrusive and reliable way to post to my blog. For short blurbs,
I want to be able to do it from anywhere, but using my cellphone is too
inconvenient (I abandoned my PDA a few years ago). I could use Google
Docs, but (1) it doesn't work with Safari and (2) I wasn't able to make
it post to my MovableType-based blog. I also want to be able to "reply"
to other people's blog posts on my own blog, but trackbacks seem to have
disappeared from all but a few blogs. Third, I had been working on a few
longer articles and I realized that (1) I don't want to mix meaningless
musings with longer better thought out pieces on the same blog and (2) I
don't know how to tell if the article is finished, so I keep revising it
over and over and over.

Any words of advice for me? :)
