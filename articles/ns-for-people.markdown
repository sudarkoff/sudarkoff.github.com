Imagine a Naming Service that maps people's unique identity handles to
their phone numbers, mailing addresses, emails and whatnot. How cool
would it be to never ever have to notify all five thousand of your
closest friends when your phone number changes, or worse yet, when you
move to another state! At the post office they would just fetch your
current mailing address and route the correspondence accordingly. Same
happens when someone is phoning, emailing or instant-messaging you.\
