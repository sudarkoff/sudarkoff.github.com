I noticed that I have about a dozen of different apps running on my
PowerBook at any given time. This would never happen to me on Windows.
What does it mean, you ask? It means Mac OS uses collections of smaller
apps to do the job instead of packing it all into a single package. It
means those smaller apps start a lot faster and they are easier to use
(and develop). It means the integration is done on the applications
level. It means you can mix and match and substitute apps to adopt your
very own unique style of getting things done. It means everybody wins â€“
developers get a chance of finding their own niche for doing the same
thing a little (or a lot) differently and users get to choose from a
variety of similar apps to better satisfy their needs!\
