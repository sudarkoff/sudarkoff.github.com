> Protecting your marriage no matter what \
>  is virtually guaranteed to destroy it.

— Say what? Aren’t we trying to protect our marriage here?

I’ll explain what I mean by that. But first, let me ask you this - what
do you expect from your marriage? What was the purpose of you marrying?
Let’s leave the religious, insurance and tax considerations aside for a
moment. And please try to dig deeper. Raising children together is a
fantastic goal, but imagine for a second that the two of you are unable
to have kids and adoption is not an option. Does your marriage ceases to
matter? I hope not. I’ll give you a minute to think this through and
will go pour myself a cup of tea in the meantime…

I’m back.
