I was playing with Apple's [Logic
Express](http://www.apple.com/logicexpress/) ("… advanced spectrum of
features and tools for computer based music production…") for a few
days, learning it's capabilities, and here's the
[result](http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/398961/6786677/audio/only_me_running.mp3.mp3).
It is very short—only about a minute and a half—but it's written in a
perfect 90 BPM tempo, which happens to be ideal for distance running, so
feel free to use it accordingly if you like it.\
