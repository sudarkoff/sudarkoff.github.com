- Χριστος Ανεστη! Христос воскресе! Christ Is Risen!\

- Αληθως Ανεστη! Во истину воскресе! Indeed He Is Risen!

Yesterday, my wife and I paid a visit to her relatives in San Francisco
to join the celebration of Orthodox Pascha. Not a thing was missing,
everything was in full accordance with the tradition. Lots of Russian
food, vodka, kulich and pascha on the table and Father Yaroslav at the
table :-)

\

Most of my wife's relatives fled Russia eighty years ago. They first
went to China, then Philippines, then Italy, then Paraguay and then some
of them settled in the U.S. As a consequence, they now speak Chinese,
Spanish, English, and Russian at the same time.

\

It is amazing how Russian culture is preserved so well in those people
in spite of their long multicultural jorney and in many cases never
being to Russia in their life!
