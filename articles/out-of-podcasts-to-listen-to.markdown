A scary thing happened to me a few seconds ago — I finished listening to
the last downloaded podcast on my iPod. I now have a funny feeling in my
stomach (or maybe it's just too much coffee, I don't know) that my day
have ended prematurely. I guess I'll listen to some music now — first
time in weeks...
