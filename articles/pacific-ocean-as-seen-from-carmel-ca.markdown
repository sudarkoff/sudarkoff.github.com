I'm standing here, looking at the ocean. I used to live on the other
side of this thing, used to watch beautiful sunrises. Now I'm getting
used to watching sunsets just as beautiful. The waves are coming to me
as they were fifteen years ago - nothing changed. I traveled all the way
from the Far East to the Wild West and the ocean is still the same. No
matter East or West, peace or war - *Pacific* Ocean is the same.
