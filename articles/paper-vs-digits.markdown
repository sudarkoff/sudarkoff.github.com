In my world paper will never beat the digits. Paper is accessible and
familiar when you need to capture the ideas (especialy on the go), but
paper is also inaccessible and bulky when you try to store and retrieve
the information later. That everyone has been falling in love with paper
lately is nothing more to me than a sign that a much better digital
experience is about to emerge. And me, I'm not waiting, I am trying hard
to make this happen. More about this later.
