Thanks to the [Speechless](http://composerplanet.com/speechless/)
podcast I have been enjoying lately, I came across a young British lad -
[Paul Antonio
Ortiz](http://chimpspanner.heavenlymediaservices.com/index.htm) - who is
doing some amazing stuff in music. He is a very crafty musician,
composer and arranger all-in-one. I have been listening to his music for
the last few hours non-stop. And mark my words - he is going to be huge
in a couple of years or so. Check him out!\
