[PocketMod](http://www.pocketmod.com/) gave me an ideaâ€”it would be nice
to have a new printing layout that one could use to print out small bits
of information in a form suitable for folding and caring around in a
pocket.\

\
And for quite some time I was looking for an app that would bring the
data from various productivity applications together (tasks for today,
phone numbers of certain people, etc.) and display it in one convenient
place (perhaps right on the desktop). Plus, you'd also be able to print
it out as a [PocketMod](http://www.pocketmod.com/)-like disposable paper
organizer using that new printing layout!\
