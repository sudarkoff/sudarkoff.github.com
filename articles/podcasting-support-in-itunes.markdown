Podcasting support in iTunes 4.9 is great! But I have a complaint (you
saw this coming, didn't you) about the way they handle podcasts on the
library level. Although they assign Podcast genre to all downloaded
files, the titles do not show up in the Library and so you cannot create
smart playlists to manage them. I used to have a very elaborate
structure of smart playlists to handle podcasts. A lot of it was
redundant and I am glad it's gone and I won't need to delete old
podcasts semi-manualy every so often, for example. But also I was
managing the load by splitting podcasts in groups and categories and now
it's gone as well and I am not very happy about that.

**Update:** I just wanted to add that in spite of any number of
complaints that I might have, iTunes supporting podcasting is HUGE and I
cannot be happier they did it! In fact, I completely switched to iTunes
to be my podcast-catching client of choice after just a few minutes of
playing with it.
