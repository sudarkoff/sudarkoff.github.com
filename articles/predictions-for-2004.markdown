I was chatting with a friend today and he showed me some quite lame list of "things that are likely to happen in year 2004 and change people's lives" (no less than that). And since everybody else is making all sorts of predictions, I felt compelled to compose my very own list as well. Here goes my "top three":

1.  Scientists will finally come up with a way of "spraying" displays on
    practically any surface and manage to pass the knowledge to
    engineers.
2.  Storage will continue to grow byte-wise and to shrink inch-wise.
3.  Some Japanese company will put together a battery that will last
    longer, weigh less and take less room than a "regular one".

All these combined will make lighter PDAs which I only care about. :-) So, what do you think of my list?
