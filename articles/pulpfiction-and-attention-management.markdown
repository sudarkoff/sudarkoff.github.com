PulpFiction was awarded an 8 out of 10 rating by [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/newsreaders-mac.ars/).
Here's what I think,
[Don](http://don.yacktman.org/blog/archives/2005/09/22/pulpfiction-reviewed)
and
[Erik](http://nslog.com/archives/2005/09/22/pulpfiction_gets_an_810_at_ars.php)^\*^.
As much as I agree with you both on the "I need to manage my news
articles" vs. "I need to manage my feeds" point, I think it would help
enourmously if you would let your users organize their feeds as well.
One of the reasons I still don't use PulpFiction (even though I bought
it more than a year ago) is because Smart Folders are just not smart
enough for me.

\

It would be ideal if I could organize my feeds myself and then let the
feedreader organize the articles for me automatically. Like
[SearchFox](http://rss.searchfox.com) but locally. (In fact, I would
love to see SearchFox provide an API for developers to utilize, but
that's a separate topic.)
