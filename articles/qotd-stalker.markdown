**[Question: Have you ever had a stalker? Or been a
stalker?](http://nslog.com/archives/2005/08/24/qotd_stalker.php)**\
\
My Answer: I don't know about stalking, but twice in my life I had
ladies beating the shit out of each other over who gets to go out with
me. Suffice it to say, I had no interest in going out with either one.\
