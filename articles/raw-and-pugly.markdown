three and a half of you still following my blog might have noticed that
I'm not writing much here lately. The reasons are plentiful and I might
write about some of them later. But one that is relevant here is that I
used to spend a significant amount of time writing my posts. I'd dump
everything "on paper" in a matter of minutes and then spend the next few
days editing the piece. But starting today and until further notice I'm
gonna try a new thing - no more editing of any kind. Just a pure
unstructured stream of raw and pugly consciousness.
