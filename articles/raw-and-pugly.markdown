![Pug and t-bone](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8156754699_a0281c0d9f_o.jpg)All three and a half of you still following my blog might have noticed that I'm not writing much here lately. The reasons are plentiful and I might write about some of them later. But one that is relevant here is that I used to spend a significant amount of time writing my posts. I'd dump everything "on paper" in a matter of minutes and then spend the next few days editing the piece. But starting today and until further notice I'm gonna try a new thing - no more editing of any kind. Just a pure unstructured stream of raw and pugly consciousness.
