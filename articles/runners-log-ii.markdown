Title: Runner's Log II

My Runner's Log is up and running (pun intended). You can find it
[here](/running/ "George's Runner's Log"). It has it's own
[Atom](/running/atom "Atom feed") feed (which even validates!), although
I can't imagine someone interested in following my progress that close.

Sadly, I couldn't find the clean and easy way to implement this kind of
thing in [MovableType](http://movabletype.org/), so I ended up coding
everything in PHP-MySQL-Smarty. It went surprisingly easy, the whole
project took only about three hours of work scattered throughout the two
weeks of frequent but short coffee breaks. Of course with approach like
this the result is a bunch of spaghetti code, but it's a tiny bits of
spaghetti code, so even if I ever need to change/add anything it won't
be a huge problem.

Anyway, now that my Runner's Log is running, I am going to take a month
off and stop running myself. I need to do it to give my knee a chance to
heal completely. Until then, see you in the gym or in the swimming pool.
