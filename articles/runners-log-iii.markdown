\
After trying a few runner's log applications and not finding what I
needed I've decided to write one myself. I want to automate as much as
possible. Obviously, for that I will need some type of tracking device
to record the speed and/or distance and possibly the heart rate.
Additionally, I want the app to be able to publish the workout
information on the weblog. I am in the slow planning mode right now and
I will appreciate any input. Please leave a comment if you'd like me to
implement some dream feature of yours.\
