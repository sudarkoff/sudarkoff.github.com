Title: Runner's Log

I was thinking about adding the runner's log to this weblog. Namely, I
need to be able to log the course, distance, pace, easiness and brief
note for each individual workout. Plus, track the mileage and
performance of the sneackers I used in the workout. It would be nice to
have the "database" of sneackers which will include the brand, name of
the store I bought the pair from, price, thumbnail, short description,
etc. and will remind me when it's time to buy a new pair.

\

Are there any plugins that would allow me to do such thing in
MovableType? Is this sort of functionality even possible to implement
within the MT3 framework without patching it?
