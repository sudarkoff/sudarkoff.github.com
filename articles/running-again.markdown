Title: Running again

I am slowly starting running again after a month break due to a minor
knee injury. This time I am set to avoid any injuries and here's how I
am going to achieve it: **I will avoid pushing myself to the limit too
soon**! Yes, it's that simple! In fact, I might stop pushing for speed
all together. I've realized that I am in this neither for speed, nor for
distance - I am in this for life, as one popular runners magazine puts
it.

...I am in this **neither for speed**, **nor for** distance...

\

So, after a week and a half of running I have found my own pace and
distance I am most comfortable with. I am running at speeds of six to
seven miles per hour for about thirty to forty minutes. Twice I had
walking breaks for a minute or two and it made all the difference in the
world, so I am now going to do it more often.

\

I am not setting any particular goals at the moment (other than avoiding
injuries), however I thought about running a marathon in the past and I
might start training for it when I feel comfortable enough with my
current running schedule. If you happen to know about any upcoming
marathons for a cancer research or any other good cause taking place in
the San Francisco Bay Area in about six months to a year, please let me
know.
