I wasn't planning on running this far today. But I never ran this route
before and it goes through the park with no trails visible on any map,
so my estimate was off by about a mile. And on top of that I made a
wrong turn (notice that odd appendix in the upper left corner of the
map) and ended up in a residential area with lots of culs-de-sac and
pretty steep hills. I had to stop and call my wife to help me find my
way out. As a result I ran eight miles instead of four. But since I just
started running after almost two months of rest (read
"procrastination"), I wasn't pushing myself too hard, so eight miles
were not a problem.\

I saw a lot of wildlife in the park - a couple of deers, lots of hares
and squirrels. But running there wasn't as fun as I hoped it would be.
The grass is very high and stinging this time of the year. Next time I
run there, I will put on pants instead of shorts.\
