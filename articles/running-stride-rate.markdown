Today I was running an improvised [5K race](/running/entry/80) (finished
it in 28:45 minutes) and I noticed that my stride rate was ranging
somewhere between 90 and 95 steps for each leg per minute. I thought it
is a bit too frequent (i.e. my stride is too short) and I probably waste
a lot of energy because of that. But when I came home and researched
this a little bit to my great surprise I've discovered that this is
exactly what they recommend the cadence should be for the best running
economy. Wow! It is nice when something like this comes naturally to
you!
