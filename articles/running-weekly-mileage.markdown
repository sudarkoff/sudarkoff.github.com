Title: Running, weekly mileage

In the last couple of months I've been slowly gaining weight and am now
about 10 pounds heavier than I was just a short two months ago.
Considering that I successfully avoided turkey coma this year and still
have New Year's culinary temptations to navigate through, that is a lot
of gain and a bit scary!

\

So I want to step my running up a notch and build my weekly mileage up
to at least 30 miles. Since my current weekly mileage is only about 10
miles on average and I cannot increase it by more than 10% per week, it
is going to take me about 16 weeks (or four months) to reach my goal. In
order to not loose the track and to keep it interesting I will be
publishing my weekly mileage reports starting Mondays.

Feel free to ridicule me publicly if I start falling behind.
