**Distance:** 5.71 mi\

#### Dec 16 - Dec 22

**Runs:** 2\

**Distance:** 8.07 mi\

I was on vacation for parts of both weeks. The last run was the first
time when I used Forerunner 305 GPS watch and heart-rate monitor that my
wife bought me for x-mass. The software that came with the device allows
you to structure, schedule and upload workouts to Forerunner in advance.
Then you just tell it to run today's workout and follow the instructions
on the screen. Chest strap was quite comfortable - something I was
worried about. Screen has just the right amount of information and is
quite easy to read. All in all, I am very satisfied with this device!
Oh, and the workout was perfect! The temperature was very nice - 50Â°F
and I did a perfect 5 mile endurance run at about 80% of estimated Max
HR.
