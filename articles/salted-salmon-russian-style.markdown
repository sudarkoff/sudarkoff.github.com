You're sick and tired of drinking your Bud and want to turn it up a
notch to start enjoying your life again? First of all, **don't drink
cheap beer**! And to top it off, here's one of my favorite family
recipes.\

\
**Fine Russian-style salted salmon\
\
**\

\
You'll need:\

-   1 package of fresh salmon from Costco (\~\$11) sans 5 'tail' inches
-   1 jar of kosher flake salt from Trader Joe's (about 75 grams)
-   2 tbsp assorted whole pepper (black, white, whatever)
-   bay leaf ad libitum

\
Cut the remaining piece of fish in half, wash it and dry it with paper
towels. Rub pieces of fish with salt. Sprinkle a little bit of salt and
peppers onto the bottom of the pot, and lay one of the pieces flat on
the bottom of pot. Take some peppers and press them into the fish, then
sprinkle some salt onto it. Lay the other piece of fish right on top oh
the first one. Repeat the procedure with pepper and salt. You should use
up all salt and pepper by this moment. Place a saucer or a small plate
on top of the fish stack, and put some weight on it (half-gallon of
water in some container will do just fine). Let the pot stand uncovered
on the kitchen counter for half a day (room temperature) and then move
it (still uncovered) to the fridge. In another 36 hours the fish is
ready to be served and enjoyed with your favorite brand of Czech beer!\

Now life is delish, isn't it?\
