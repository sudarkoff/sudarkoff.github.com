\
I am going to [SD Conference](http://sdexpo.com/) (March 14-18). I am
trying to balance between the C++, Modeling & Design and Requirements &
Analysis tracks which is close to impossible. If you are going as well,
drop me a line. It is too late to register for the conference, I guess,
but the Expo (March 15-17, \$50) should still be available.\

\
**Update:**The SD West 2005 events I will go to are listed in my [public
calendar](//home.sudarkoff.com/webdav/public/Public.ics).\
