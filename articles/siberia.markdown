My old friend [Paul Philippov](http://paulphilippov.com/) just sent me
this picture. It is 10°F outside and snowing... in April... I lived in
this [big Siberian
city](http://arw.dcn-asu.ru/regioninfo/cities/barnaul/) for almost
twelve years... As much as I hate to promote any stereotypes about
Siberia (it is not on the North Pole, you know), it gets really nasty
there at times... And summer temperatures average 70°F which feels much
hotter than in San Francisco because there's no breeze.
