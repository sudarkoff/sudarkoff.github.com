This is a brilliant service, thank you, [Tyler](http://tylerhall.ws/)!
With the immediate support for TextMate and WordPress and an open API so
that others could integrate it into their own tools - it's a killer
application!

\

Some king of line-by-line code-reviewing/commenting/rating feature to
help the community improve the quality of the code would be nice. But I
am sure Tyler has plenty of his own ideas on how to improve the service
further.
