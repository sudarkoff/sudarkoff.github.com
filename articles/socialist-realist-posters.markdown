Wow, what a nice [collection of Soviet
Posters](http://www.iisg.nl/exhibitions/chairman/sovintro.html "Soviet Posters")
(via
[Boing-Boing](http://boingboing.net/ "Boing-Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things")).
This site covers the most interesting period in history of Socialist
Realist culture - years from the Great October Revolution till the
beginning of the World War II. The echo of this tremendous propaganda
effort lasted for decades enfluencing different aspects of Soviet
culture almost up until the very end of the USSR.
