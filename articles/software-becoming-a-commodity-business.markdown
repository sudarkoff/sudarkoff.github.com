As I said before, software is a lot like medicine. Some doctors treat
the ordinary cold, others specialize in brain surgery. True, ever since
antibiotics were discovered, treating many illnesses must have become a
pretty mundane business (I have no idea, of course, just guessing). It
might appear that all doctors do these days is prescribe either
painkillers or antibiotics. But does it mean that medicine is a
commodity business? If only!
