[SEAL Pup Elite](http://sogknives.com/store/E37.html) has a very
cool-looking 4.85"-long full tang blade with a spine rasp and an
injection-molded glass handle with deep comfortable finger grooves that
make the handle sit very comfortably in your hand. This knife is
available with both partially serrated and straight blades - I
personally prefer the straight edge. Its weight and blade thickness feel
just right and overall the knife feels very solid.

Initially I bought the knife with the Kydex sheath because it is quite
compact, lightweight and has a neat little feature - a grove that
reveals a section of the blade which allows you to cut rope without
taking the knife out of its sheath. But after trying different ways to
carry the knife (including designing and sewing my own custom thigh
attachment system) I realized that the nylon sheath was just better
suited for my situation. First of all, it has an additional compartment
which I ended up using to store my Leatherman Charge multitool. But more
importantly, it has a [MOLLE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE)
attachment on the back, which opens up carrying possibilities galore.
Also, I was able to attach a small loop of webbing to the side of the
sheath for the firesteel.

I used the knife quite extensively at a week-long [survival
camp](/edge.html "The Edge") and I must say I am very happy with its
performance. The blade is equally good for chopping down small trees,
making a throwing stick, carving a pair of chopsticks or a replica of
the knife itself. About the only issue that I had with this knife was
the spine rasp - I would prefer if the knife did not have it as it hurts
a little when I press against it with my thumbs while carving. But it's
a personal preference and I wouldn't hold it against this knife.

All in all, I am very happy with my SOG and would highly recommend it to
anyone who is looking for a dependable fixed-blade knife. Would I
recommend it as a survival knife? Well, it's a highly debated question.
Some say the blade should be around 4 inches long. Others rightfully
note that there's nothing a small blade can do that a big blade cannot.
Yet others seek knives with hollow handles to put a small stash of
goodies inside (my opinion of those knives is not very favorable). But
in the end, it all comes down to personal preference - choose the blade
you'll be comfortable carrying with you at all times. For me, this is
SOG SEAL Pup Elite!
