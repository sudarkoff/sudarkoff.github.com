Title: Spam

I have gotten 79 junk emails since yesterday! But for
[SpamAssassin](http://us.spamassassin.org/) I would have been entirely
exhausted trying to sort through this pile of dirt and annoyance. I have
a feeling that unless we take radical measures as soon as possible,
email might become unusable for the most part. We need something
absolutely out of the ordinary. Something that either eliminates the
very idea of unwanted mail, or makes it impossible to hide the source
the junk is coming from. Am I dreaming?

\

SpamAssassin is great but I spent almost two weeks tweaking it so that
none of the good emails is lost. Yes, I know that smart people hide
their real email addresses, but (1) I don't believe it solves the
problem completely and (2) I don't like hiding. Is there hope, or do we
have to suck it up and learn to live with it?
