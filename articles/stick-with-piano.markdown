I was at [King Crimson's](http://www.king-crimson.com/) concert,
watching [Trey Gunn](http://www.treygunn.com/) do a fantastic job and I
got an idea. I think that a [touch
guitar](http://guitargeek.com/gearview/524/) (or a
[Stick](http://www.stick.com/)) and a piano would go together as a very
colorful duo! Two-handed tapping is quite a [powerful
technique](http://www.stick.com/articles/evolution/), so it would be
very interesting to see how Stick will go along with the king of all
instruments - piano.
