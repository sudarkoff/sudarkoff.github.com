I just contacted some russian webmail service to ask why they blocked my
IP address, filed the ticket and got the following response:\

> \
> Надеемся, что Служба поддержки быстро и компетентно ответит на Ваш
> вопрос.\

\
Which roughly translates as following:\

> \
> We hope that Support will answer your question in a fast and competent
> manner.\

\
Great! They **hope**! I have nothing to worry about…\
