I am in the process of switching the hosting provider (again). This
weblog is going to be moved last, so if everything else is down, come
here for news. But hopefully the transition will be smooth and seamless.

\

**Update:** As mentioned in the footer of this weblog it is now powered
by [Hurricane Electric](http://www.he.com). I also wanted to take this
opportunity and re-factor my Runner's Log a bit. As a result, not
everything is working there at the moment. But on the plus side, I'll
have a much tidier code and thus it's gonna be much easier for me to add
new exciting functionality to my log (more on that later).

\

All that is left now is to switch the mail server to the new host and
pull the plug on the old hosting.
