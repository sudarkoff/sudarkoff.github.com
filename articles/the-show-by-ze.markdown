My favorite video podcast is "the show" by [Ze
Frank](http://zefrank.com/ "the show"). Here's the snippet from my
transcript of one of his latest episodes:

> I run out of ideas every day. Each day I live in mortal fear that I
> used up the last idea that will ever come to me. If you don't want to
> run out of ideas, the best thing to do is not to execute them. You can
> tell yourself that you don't have the time or resources to do them
> right. Then they stay around in your head like brain crack. No matter
> how bad things get at least you have all those good ideas that you'll
> get to later. Some people get addicted to that brain crack and the
> longer they wait the more they convince themselves of how perfectly
> that idea should be executed. And they imagine it on a beautiful
> platter with glitter and rose petals and everyone's clapping *for
> them*. But the..., but the..., but the bummer is most ideas kinda suck
> when you do 'em. And no matter how much you plan you'll still have to
> do something for the first time. And you almost guaranteed the first
> time you do something it will blow. But somebody who does something
> bad three times still has three times the experience of that other
> person who is still dreaming of all the applause. When I get an idea I
> try to get it out in the world as fast as possible. Cause I certainly
> don't want to be addicted to brain crack.
