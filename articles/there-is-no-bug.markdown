Author of the blog "Hyper Agile Thinking" (oy vey!) in his article
["There is no Bug. It is not the Bug that Bends, it is Only
Yourself"](http://damonpoole.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/there-is-no-bug-it-is-not-the-bug-that-bends-it-is-only-yourself/)
argues that:

Oh, there's no bug, you bet! But behind all those big words you are
missing another important problem - there is no program and there is no
process either. It is **all** an illusion (if you follow the original
logic of "there's no spoon")! So, while I wholeheartedly agree that it
is more accurate to treat bugs like something internal (and really,
let's call them defects already?), it doesn't really change anything.
Because bugs only "appear" when internal reality collides with external
and there is nothing you can do about it. Agile or not, you still have
to go outside and test your theories on the harsh real world. You know,
by actually giving your shit to people and hoping nothing explodes.

And while I am at it, don't you think that "agile methodology" is an
oxymoron?!
