It would be pretty cool if you could use the trackpad on your laptop as
a mini graphics tablet. Perhaps, with a special pen that enables this
mode. It probably wouldn't meet the needs of professional graphics
designers, but would be pretty useful for quick sketches, diagrams and
whatnot. A pen is still the most natural tool for free-form input, so I
am fairly positive that this feature will be appreciated.
