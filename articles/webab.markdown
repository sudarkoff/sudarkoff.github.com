[Webcal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcal) allows you to subscribe to
other people's or public calendars. I wonder why there is no similar
thing for address books (webaddr)? Or have I missed it? Imagine, if you
could subscribe to your address book on some social networking website
and never have to worry about phone numbers and email addresses being
obsolete as long as your contacts keep their profiles current (and now
they will have an incentive). Imagine, if you could update your own
contact information in one place (perhaps, your local address book) and
have it pushed to all your contacts automatically and unobtrusively. We
already have all the bits and pieces in place, so the only task left is
to repackage and popularize it.
