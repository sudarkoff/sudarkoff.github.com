\
I had the weirdest dream today (I swear I am not making it up)!\

\
The four musketeers just cried their motto—"One for All and All for
One," – when Constance greeted them approaching:\
\
— Hey guys, I translated your funny slogan into French: "Un pour tous et
tous pour un."\
\
— You can teach a monkey how to roll the drums, – replied Athos with
noticeable disgust in his voice – but it takes a real man to win the
battle!\

\
What gives?\
