Today was a grocery shopping day. When we came home and started to
unload food into the fridge, we discovered that something we had just
bought stunk like it was rottening for quite some time already. We were
infuriated trying to find what stunk that bad, but to no avail â€“ all
obvious "candidates" were thoroughly sniffed at and ruled out. When
after a few minutes we were ready to start taking things apart, I
remembered that I picked up a piece of semi-soft French cheese at Trader
Joe's to try. And so I took a sniff and almost passed out! Good god, it
stunk like hell! We started to think about taking it down to a sea-side
town, and burying it on the beach. But then, again, we were afraid that
it would give the place quite a rap and changed our mind.\
