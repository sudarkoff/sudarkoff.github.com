What motivates people to whine about deficiencies and flaws in products
they never held in their hands and probably can't afford either?

\

Take the Apple's new MacBook Air for example. What do the omega geeks
think will be the reason of its demise? Let's enumerate: (1) it has no
FireWire port, (2) it has no DVD drive, (3) battery is not
user-replaceable, (4) no ethernet port, (5) no ExpressCard slot and, my
favorite, (6) it's too thin! The conclusion: "it looks good but isn't
for the power user." Power user, I gather, is the one with the most
power bricks in his backpack. So the geeks have spoken: MacBook Air is a
failure because the random Joe Shmoe couldn't afford it and therefore
had to come up with all those lame excuses to use in a conversation with
his fellow losers. Allrighty then!

Now let's see what a person from the **intended** audience would think
about all those deficiencies: (1) what's FireWire?, (2) I can watch, rip
and burn DVD's on any of my other Macs, (3) never replaced a battery in
my laptop and even if I ever need to, I'll ask that genius at the Apple
store to do it for me, (4) with integrated 802.11n who needs ethernet?,
(5) what's ExpressCard?, (6) when my colleagues see me enter the
conference room with only a manila envelope in my hand and produce a
stunning looking laptop from it they'll die of envy!
