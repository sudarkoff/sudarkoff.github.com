We're officially a Windows-free household as of last night. We replaced
our last Windows desktop with a shiny new Mac Mini. We still have my old
Sony Vaio laptop serving as a media-center in our living room. But now
that my wife saw Front Row in action I don't know if Vaio is going to
hold for much longer.
