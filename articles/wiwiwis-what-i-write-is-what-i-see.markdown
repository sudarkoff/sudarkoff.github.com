To find a simple yet distinctive name for a new thing is not only an
important task but a very difficult one as well. I have been considering
different names for my blog for days now. I tried "George's Blog" (yes,
it is simple), "Sudarkoffs' Weblog", "Couch News" and a few others -
anything but distinctive. Finally, I opened a nice little
[program](http://www.wbloggar.com), which I use to write my blogs. The
program is WYSIWYG which made me think: "Wow! WIWIWIS is just what I was
looking for". "**W**hat **I** **W**rite **I**s **W**hat **I** **S**ee"
is exactly what this blog is all about. I am not trying to enlighten the
world with whatever essential knowledge I might possess or to show off
my great talent (who am I kidding, right!?). I'm like a Plato's fool - I
speak not because I have something to say, but because I have to say
something. So here I go! Welcome to my Kunstkamera^1^ of ordinary things
- What I Write Is What I See!\
