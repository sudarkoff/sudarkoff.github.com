[Workrave](http://www.workrave.org/) is a program that assists in the
recovery and prevention of Repetitive Strain Injury. Among its less
visible features is the page that lists all sorts of statistics. For
example, I have found today that on the average I do about 3,000 mouse
clicks and 13,000 keystrokes a day - it turnes out I do quite a bit of
typing at work.
