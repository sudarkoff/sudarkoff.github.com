        <h1>About George</h1>
        
        <blockquote>“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — C.G. Jung</blockquote>
        
        <p class="one-drop-cap">In two and a half decades of my career, I’ve worked at companies ranging in size from 1  (just me, myself, and I) to well over 100,000 people. The industries, products, and cultures varied greatly as well. But one pattern I saw repeat over and over again regardless of the industry and the size of the company—technical leaders struggle to adjust to their new roles and often fail due to lack of the right kind of support. And it happens even in organizations that invest in leadership training for their managers.</p>

        <p>There are as many leadership styles as there are leaders. And what works for an expansive extrovert might not work for a contemplative introvert. Yet the quiet introverts often make the best leaders: Barack Obama, Marissa Mayer, Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg, Guy Kawasaki, Bill Gates—just to name a few. What these examples demonstrate beyond any doubt is that it’s not only possible but even necessary, to find the style of leadership that is true to your nature in order to succeed!</p>
        
        <h2>My Coaching</h2>
        
        <p>As Carl Jung said: “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” This is where everything starts. And so the first pillar of my practice is awareness. I will help you start or deepen the practice of building your self-awareness, raise your emotional intelligence.</p>

        <p>But awareness is not enough. Most people already know what they should be doing, but they don't know how to get it done. Our natural tendency is to blame, to find the reason we’re not successful. Best case scenario, we blame ourselves: “I’m too direct”, “I let people boss me around“, “I freeze under stress”. But whoever or whatever we blame, we give away our power and responsibility to change. Luckily, curiosity—a real-life superpower, and the second pillar of my coaching philosophy—allows you to move past the blame and towards growth and learning.</p>

        <p>Last but not least, once you are aware of the problem you want to tackle and know how to get it done, it's time to act. Consistently and relentlessly. Day in and day out. No matter what!.. If that sounds like a near impossibility—don’t worry, there is nothing wrong with you. Nobody can stay motivated forever. Motivation is an unreliable tool. Life constantly challenges our best-laid plans and you will have days when even getting out of bed is an achievement. What will allow you to keep moving forward without a fail is the ability to develop and maintain good routines and lasting habits—the third pillar of my practice.</p>

        <h2>My Coaching Toolbox</h2>
        
        <h3>Certified Tiny Habits Coach</h3>
        <p>Tiny Habits® is a breakthrough behavior change method developed by BJ Fogg,  Director of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford.</p>
        
        <h3>Certified ACT Practitioner</h3>
        <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) stems from traditional behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Clients learn to stop avoiding, denying, and struggling with their inner emotions and, instead, accept that these feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations that should not prevent them from moving forward.</p>
        
        <h3>Certified MBCT Practitioner</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a modified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It incorporates mindfulness practice to help clients identify and modify dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and negative or irrational beliefs and thoughts. I will teach you how to break away from negative thought patterns that are often the cause of a downward spiral.</p>
        
        <h3>Mindfulness Meditation Practitioner</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation is unique in that it helps us become aware of what is already true moment by moment. It teaches us to be unconditionally present with whatever is happening, no matter what it is.</p>
