        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <h2>Q: You’ll just tell me what to do?</h2>
        <p>Not at all! I’ll lend you my training, insight, and experience and together we’ll figure out how to help you achieve your goals.</p>

        <h2>Q: Are you going to motivate me, like Tony Robbins?</h2>
        <p>Motivation is not something you do to people. Motivation to behave a particular way is influenced by your personality, upbringing, your current situation, and many other factors. You can temporarily “boost” somebody’s motivation by giving them a pep talk (or scaring them into action). But motivation is fickle, unreliable, a limited resource, and often heavily influenced by external factors. If you’ve ever gone grocery shopping after a substantial meal, you know what I’m talking about.</p>

        <p>True lasting changes do not rely on motivation, instead, they come from understanding human behavior and using that knowledge to make tiny changes and wire in new habits in small and incremental ways. Those tiny incremental changes then snowball into an unstoppable momentum. I will teach you the behavior change method that’s deeply rooted in science, and which you’ll use to achieve sustainable results.</p>

        <h2>Q: Will you help me with my mindset?</h2>
        <p>Mindset conditions behavior, so we’ll definitely examine yours and see if it holds you back in any way. If you've ever felt like you had one foot on the gas and another on the brake—you know what I'm talking about. However, developing awareness beyond a specific mindset is our ultimate goal.</p>

        <p>Developing awareness will allow you to adjust how you think and behave depending on the situation you're in. And not just follow a script that worked for somebody else, in a different situation, once, maybe.</p>

        <h2>Q: Will you help me improve my performance at work?</h2>
        <p>Performance is an outcome, but never the main focus of what we’ll be doing in our sessions. Giant leaps in performance at work happen when the rest of your life is in balance.</p>

        <h2>Q: I’ve been told I’m not coachable, will you be able to help me?</h2>
        <p>When somebody tells you you’re not coachable, what they really mean is that they are not qualified to help you.</p>

        <p>I cannot guarantee that I’ll be able to help you. But I will be upfront with you if I can’t, and I’ll do my best to help you find somebody who can.</p>

        <h2>Q: Are you a certified coach?</h2>
        <p>I hold a few certifications—you can find the list of some of the most relevant certifications, tools, and approaches I use in my practice on my <a href="/coaching/about.html">About</a> page.</p>

        <p>However, my certifications do not absolve you of the responsibility to select the right coach for yourself with care. Talk to a few coaches and choose one that can better help you reach your goals. I invite you to schedule a free introductory session and experience firsthand what it’s like working with me.</p>

        <h2>Q: How do I work with you?</h2>
        <p>I invite you to schedule a free—no obligations—call with me to find out if we are a good fit for each other and discuss the details.</p>
