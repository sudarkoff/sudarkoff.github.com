This is my personal space dedicated to hobbies, side-projects, and just random stuff I find interesting. Be warned, I've been writing and posting stuff here for a few decades. Some of what I've written might be now out of sync with my tastes, views, and even reality. I choose to leave it all as is for posterity.
