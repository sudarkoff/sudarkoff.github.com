This is my personal space dedicated to hobbies, side-projects, and just random stuff that I find amusing.

Be warned, I've been writing and posting here for over three decades. Some of what I've written as a teenager might be now out of sync with my tastes, beliefs, and even reality. Sometimes, I also publish works-in-progress here, to get early feedback from folks. I choose to leave it all as is for posterity, as a record of my growth (or more likely a decline, as I enter my 6th decade).
