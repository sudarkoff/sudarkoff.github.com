As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen). I've tried my hand at translating a couple into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability on my part), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted to translate the shortest and least rhymed one. Here's the result:

    Your face is a ripe peach
    On it rottenness has no place
    Very, very boring face...

It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it's better rhymed now :-)
