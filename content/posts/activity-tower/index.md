On January 1st, 2012 I sketched an ideaâ€”an activity tower for my yet to be born son. Cooking is a big part of our family life, and I wanted my future son to be able to participate in this activity.

The idea was to build the tower out of 3/4-inch plywood, using only my table saw, a router, and a drill press. Here's what I came up with in SketchUp:

I didn't want to use the traditional woodworking joinery, like a box joint. I wanted to be able to disasemmble and store or transport the tower flat. So I decided to go the Ikea way and use the bolts to hold the pieces of plywood together. I already had plenty of bolts, but not the barrel nuts. And instead of ordering the nuts from McMaster-Carr I decided to whip up a home-made version from the materials I had on hand. I had a 3/4-inch steel pipe, so I cut it into the appropriately sized pieces and drilled and tapped the holes.

Here's the final result:

And here's a test piece to make sure my home-made joinery would work:

After cutting the pieces and sanding the edges, I put a few layers of varnish on everything:

And here's the activity tower assembled:

And a few months later, as soon as my son was able to stand on his own, he was helping aroud the kitchen. Here he's helping me wash the dishes:
