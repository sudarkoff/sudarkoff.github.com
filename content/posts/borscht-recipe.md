My dad's borscht recipe that he has been cooking for 50 years.

## Ingredients
- 500g of beef with bones
- 3L of water
- 200g of root vegetables (e.g., onion, carrot, parsley root, radish)
- 200g of shredded cabbage
- 200g of beets
- 100g of tomates
- 300g of potatoes
- bay leaf, pepper, salt, herbs to taste

## Method
- put the beef in the pot and add water
- simmer for a minimum of 2 hours, add salt after about 1h30m
- cut the root vegetables into 10mm cubes and sauté in vegetable oil
- separately sauté shredded cabbage until soft
- coarsely grate the beets and sauté for 15-20 minutes, until fully cooked
- blanche the tomatoes, cut them into pieces, and sauté in vegetable oil for 10-15 minutes on low heat
- remove the beef from the pot and filter the broth
- then add the sauteed root vegetables and cabbage to the broth and set on medium heat
- when it starts to boil again, reduce the heat to simmer
- add the potatoes cut into 15mm cubes and cook for 10-15 min
- add the sauteed beets and cook for another 10 min
- cut or shred the beef into small-ish pieces and add back to the soup
- finally add the sauteed tomatoes, bay leaf, pepper, herbs and the borscht is ready!
- serve with sour cream
