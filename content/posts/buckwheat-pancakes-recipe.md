This is my favorite recipe for pancakes. I made it a dozen times in the last few months. Please note that ratios are given **by weight**, not volume. Invest in kitchen scale if you’re serious about cooking, they make getting consistent results so much easier.

Buckwheat pancakes are best enjoyed with honey and hot tea.

## Ingredients (by weight)
- 1 part organic buckwheat flour
- 1 part whole wheat flour
- 2 parts milk
- 1 part eggs
- 1/2 part extra virgin olive oil
- salt and cinnamon to taste

## Method
Separate egg whites from yokes. Mix yokes with flour, milk, olive oil, salt and cinnamon—don’t overdo it. At this point you should get a pretty thick batter—don’t worry about it. Next, beat the egg whites until you get the nice stiff peaks—this is a very important step, do not skip it. Then gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Make sure you do not to lose too many air bubbles, they are what is going to make your pancakes fluffy and light. Pour 1/4 cup of batter on a lightly oiled pan and cook until ready on medium high heat.

## Yield
If you start with one egg and go from there, you should end up with 4-6 pancakes depending on the size of the egg.
