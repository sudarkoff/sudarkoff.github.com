## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 1 pinch of salt
- 3 tbs of brown sugar
- 30g of butter
- 200g of all purpose flower
- 0.5L of whole milk
- 1 generous splash of Amaretto (alt: vanilla extract, Rhum, any other flavorful booze)

## Method

### Batter

1. Beat the eggs
2. Add the sugar and salt, and stir well
3. Add the melted butter, and stir well
4. Add some flour until the batter gets more uniform and then add some milk to make it smooth, continue until all flour rand milk have been added
5. Add Amaretto
6. Let the batter rest for an hour

### Cooking

1. You will need a ladle, some melted butter in a small container and a brush to oil the pan
2. Set the pan on a medium heat
3. Brush the pan with a little bit of melted butter (repeat every 5-6 crêpes)
4. Using the ladle, pour some batter onto the pan while tilting and turning it to cover the entire surface of the pan with batter
5. Take care not to make it too thick, these are not pancakes!
6. Once the edges of the batter start to lift and the crêpe does not stick to the pan anymore, turn it over
7. Let the crêpe cook for a minute more, then slide it to a warm plate and optionally brush some butter on it
