## Ingredients
- 1 package of fresh salmon from Costco (approx. $11) sans 5 'tail' inches
- 1 jar of kosher flake salt from Trader Joe's (about 75 grams)
- 2 tbsp assorted whole pepper (black, white, whatever)
- bay leaf ad libitum

## Method
1. Cut the pieces of salmon in half, wash them and dry with paper towels. 
2. Rub some salt into salmon.
3. Sprinkle some salt and peppers on the bottom of the pot, and lay the first piece of salmon flat in the pot. Take some peppers and press them into the salmon, then sprinkle some salt as well.
4. Place the remaining pieces on top of each other, repeating the procedure with pepper and salt. You should use up all the salt and pepper by the end.
5. Place a saucer or a small plate on top of the salmon stack, and put some weight on it (half a gallon of water in a container will do just fine).
6. Let the pot stand uncovered on the kitchen counter for half a day at room temperature and then move it still uncovered to the fridge.
7. In another 36 hours the salmon is ready to be served and enjoyed with your favorite brand of Czech beer!
