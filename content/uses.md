## Keyboard: Kinesis Advantage

In September of 2007 I was tired of experiencing numbness in my fingers and the near constant pain in my wrists. I certainly didn't want it to escalate to a carpal tunnel, so I went to our ergonomics department and asked to a better keyboard. They bought me [Kinesis Advantage](https://a.co/d/i91Rlyy). And that's the keyboard I've been using ever since.

It's a keyboard that attracts attention. When people see it for the first time, they always make a comment. They wonder how long it took me to get used to it. I'd say after about a month I was comfortable.

It's a programmable keyboard, meanign you can reassign any key. And it's has the built-in Dvorak layout in addition to QWERTY.

I use Dvorak, as a matter of fact. So most people, when they sit at my computer, are not able to do anything.
