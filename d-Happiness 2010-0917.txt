We have little (if any) control over things. But we have a lot of control over how we feel about things. Forget about this and you'll sink deep into a depression. Because nothing is really and truly the way you want it to be. But if you keep an open mind and try to learn from **any** experience then you'll be as happy as a sandboy.
