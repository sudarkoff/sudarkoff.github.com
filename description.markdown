### About

Hello, my name is [George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_(given_name)). The name origin is Greek (Γεώργιος) and it means “farmer”: Γεώ – “earth”, εργο – “to work”.

I am a software developer by trade. I have a full time job at a small storage virtualization startup. And I also work on various fun projects during my copious free time. My side projects are usually related to my hobbies, which include electronics, rock climbing, running, biking, yoga, cooking, playing musical instruments, writing, making physical things and various other pursuits.
