### About

Hello, my name is [George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_(given_name)). The name origin is Greek (Γεώργιος) and it means “farmer”: Γεώ – “earth”, εργο – “to work”. In Russian, which is my native tongue, it is Георгий (or Гоша, Жора and even Егор) -- can you tell Cyrillic alphabet was derived from Greek? But my russian friends call me Yura (Юра) or Yuri (Юрий) -- it is much shorter and easier to pronounce. In Japanese, Yuri (ユリ) means “lily” and is often used to refer to all things lesbian.

I am a software developer by trade. Since the early nineties I’ve been writing software professionally and nowadays I enjoy it even more, because many more things are possible. I have a full time job at a small storage virtualization startup (and we are hiring exceptional C/C++ engineers with storage experience). I also work on various fun projects during my copious free time. Often, my side projects are related to my hobbies, which include electronics, rock climbing, running, biking, yoga, cooking, playing musical instruments, writing, making physical things and various other pursuits.
