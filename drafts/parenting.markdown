The very first lesson, that I learned even before Max was born, is to be flexible. Roll with the punches. Never judge other parents' choices. Especially if your own child hasn't reached that stage of development yet.One of the main challenges for me as a parent is learning to say yes. We tend to blurt out nos almost automatically. It's the same BS that makes up the "zero tolerance" policies. It's just so much easier to say no than to take time to weigh in the facts, estimate the pros and cons and to come up with the reasonable answer. Which in many cases would turn to be yes, my experience shows.
