HOW TO ROCK CLIMB (AND ENJOY IT EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T)

I'm sitting in a quiet café, on the second-floor terrace of the Borders store, sipping italian soda, soaking up the distant sounds of a spicy Mexican band, broken foot propped on a chair, anxiously awaiting even a partial recovery so I could start climbing again. I can't help but wonder if I'll ever commute by bicycle again. Don't get me wrong, I love biking a lot and my gas-hog of a car being totally awesome for outdoors is not so good for a 3-mile daily commute. But I love rock climbing so much more that being grounded for two months because of a silly accident that didn't involve any climbing is just too hard to process. But despite the reasoning being completely broken - an injury is an injury, climbing-related or not I'm still grounded - this is a welcomed turn of mood.

I started climbing exactly two years ago and I've never been sidelined by an injury in all this time. I slowly but surely progressed through the grades and was inching in on the coveted 5.12. The last project I was working on before the accident was a short and straightforward, but negative and very pumpy 5.11d. I climbed it five or six times and was peeling off from the same second-to-last move. I was getting more and more frustrated with my lack of progression and inability to learn. I was focusing too much on performance and because I was not getting instant results, I was starting to dread doing something I supposedly loved doing! How did I get from the shivers of excitement to the dread of anticipating a failure without even noticing it?

A couple of months ago my girlfriend and I visited Squamish - a stellar climbing destination in British Columbia, with fantastic cracks, mind boggling slabs and plentiful bouldering - a climbers' dream. On our first climbing day we decided to try an unknown short crack at the base of the Chief's Bulletheads wall that looked doable. We swung by the wall, that was virtually within the spitting distance of our tent, I quickly racked up, Adrienne took me on belay and I started to climb. The first few moves were solid - I tried them the day before while scouting the rock - and I proceeded to jam a few feet before stopping top place some protection. The crack was dirty but obviously climbed by someone else not long ago - here and there I could see chalk on the rock. Placing pro in a dirty rock always feels sketchy and that was the first strike against my psyche that day.

The next section was too wide for jamming and required laybacking. It's always a tricky transition for me to go from solid secure jamming to strenuous and precarious laybacking. But I kept my feet high and moved past those few feet to a good stance with perfect hand-sized gear placements. But then I needed to repeat the transition to laybacking again. This time though, the crack was too wide for any of my gear and too runout to afford a fall on a slabby wall below. I spent a few minutes psyching myself up to climb that stretch, but when I reached the next solid hand jam and placed some gear I couldn't relax - I saw a bolt just four feet above me and I just had to reach and clip it. As soon as I reached and touched the hanger, however, the last drops of my enthusiasm evaporated entirely - the hanger was spinning like a TK leave in a light summer breeze and the bolt itself was moving in the rock quite a bit.

The bolt was unnecessary. I was sitting in a perfectly sized hand crack with plenty of potential for bombproof gear placements - I just needed to place a couple of pieces and move on to the roof traverse. This is where I needed to think clearly and I wasn't. All I could think about was how crappy that bolt was. I was picturing myself falling and pilling the bolt out of the rock. In a haze of frustration my decision was to place a nut, equalize it with the bolt and lower to the ground, cleaning on the way down. And so I did.

Earlier, looking at the lengthy roof traverse that lead to the anchors at the far right end of the roof, I decided that it would be okay for me to leave some gear there if I found the traverse too hard and decided to bail. Secretly, however, I was hoping that I wouldn't have to, that I would either be able to aid it or perhaps even free cleanly. That's why I was upset to leave even just one nut in this crap *only because of that one crappy bolt*! Bottom line: I didn't know the grade of the route, but it felt firmly within my range; I was more or less enjoying the climb until I saw the bolt even though it was unnecessary to protect the climb.

So how did a perfectly enjoyable climb turn into a disappointment so quickly? The answer is simple - it didn't, it was doomed from the start. Our mood, our emotions are not created outside of our brains. The way we react to things happening around us is influenced by the language we use to think and talk about our experiences. Have you noticed how great climbers call scary climbs "exciting"? It's hard to enjoy a scary dirty crack with insecure stances and sketchy protection. It's an entirely different experience when you climb the same route as a pristine, adventurous one, with thin gymnastic stances and creative pro. When you fail on the same move twenty times in a row - it's no fun. But when you learn something new and interesting about your body and your mind every time you fall on that very same move - you can do it all day long and never get bored or discouraged. Rock climbing is FUN!
