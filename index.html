    <h1>Lead with the confidence you grew accustomed to as a technical expert!</h1>

    <!--div class="callout">
        <p class="callout"><strong>Before working with me:</strong> You’re not sure of yourself, you feel overwhelmed by your new responsibilities. Maybe you’re even thinking about going back to being an individual contributor.</p>

        <p class="callout"><strong>After working with me:</strong> You are a self-aware, confident, and influential leader. You lead with integrity, empathy, and gratitude. You’re an expert delegator and an authentic communicator.</p>

    <p><strong>“I’m just no longer sure of myself, I feel overwhelmed by my new responsibilities.”</strong> I often hear these words from my clients—some of the best technical experts in their fields.</p>
    
    <p>You see, most newly minted engineering managers think… “the years I spent honing my technical skills will give me <strong>authority and influence in my new role</strong>.” But the truth is… leaders are not admired for their technical skills—<strong>what got you here won’t get you there!</strong></p>
    
    <p>Most new technical leaders think… that if they read the right book, or take the right course they’ll finally <strong>feel confident in their leadership abilities</strong>. The truth is… it’s not about acquiring more knowledge, <strong>it’s about letting go of your old habits and expectations</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Most new managers think... that confidence means no longer having fear. The truth is... <strong>confident leaders walk towards their fear</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Here’s the good news—with your leadership potential, <strong>you are only scratching the surface of the impact you could have</strong>! I promise, if you take the lessons and put in the work, you can and will become an extraordinary leader faster than you actually believed possible.⁠</p>
