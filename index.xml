&lt;p>People believe that giving in to a temptation is a weakness. And they judge harshly those who can&amp;rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&amp;rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things George Uses and Loves</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/uses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:32:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/uses/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="keyboard-kinesis-advantage">Keyboard: Kinesis Advantage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In September of 2007 I was tired of experiencing numbness in my fingers and the near constant pain in my wrists. I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want it to escalate to a carpal tunnel, so I went to our ergonomics department and asked to a better keyboard. They bought me &lt;a href="https://a.co/d/i91Rlyy">Kinesis Advantage&lt;/a>. And that&amp;rsquo;s the keyboard I&amp;rsquo;ve been using ever since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://george.sudarkoff.com/kinesis-advantage.jpeg" alt="Kinesis Advantage">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a keyboard that attracts attention. When people see it for the first time, they always make a comment. They wonder how long it took me to get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;d say after about a month I was comfortable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distributed Ops for Distributed Apps</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/distributed-ops-proposal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/distributed-ops-proposal/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>My proposal for a talk I delivered at Velocity Amsterdam, 2016.

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the world of microservices, when things are moving fast and constantly breaking, the accepted wisdom is that teams must own the whole stack and operate their services themselves. But how much stack is &amp;ldquo;the whole stack&amp;rdquo;? How do we ensure that operational standards are consistent across the organization? What&amp;rsquo;s the right balance between consistent standards and the ability to move fast?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crêpes</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/crepes-recipe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 20:37:55 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/crepes-recipe/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 pinch of salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tbs of brown sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30g of butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g of all purpose flower&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0.5L of whole milk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 generous splash of Amaretto (alt: vanilla extract, Rhum, any other flavorful booze)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="method">Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="batter">Batter&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Beat the eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the sugar and salt, and stir well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the melted butter, and stir well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add some flour until the batter gets more uniform and then add some milk to make it smooth, continue until all flour rand milk have been added&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add Amaretto&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let the batter rest for an hour&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="cooking">Cooking&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You will need a ladle, some melted butter in a small container and a brush to oil the pan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set the pan on a medium heat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brush the pan with a little bit of melted butter (repeat every 5-6 crêpes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the ladle, pour some batter onto the pan while tilting and turning it to cover the entire surface of the pan with batter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take care not to make it too thick, these are not pancakes!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the edges of the batter start to lift and the crêpe does not stick to the pan anymore, turn it over&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let the crêpe cook for a minute more, then slide it to a warm plate and optionally brush some butter on it&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Team,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It became clear to me in the last few days that there&amp;rsquo;s not enough clarity about what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We keep talking about relatively small and specific things, but we never discuss the philosophy behind it all. What type of system are we building? Can&amp;rsquo;t we just install Puppet and Terraform and call it done? And focus instead on something more glamorous than spinning VMs?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Does It Make You A Better Person?</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/</guid><description>&lt;p>Does running make you a better person? Does climbing mountains make you a better person? Does becoming a parent make you a better person?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some people seem to believe that it does. And there are plenty of those (especially those that don&amp;rsquo;t run, climb, or have kids) who believe that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. And I tend to agree with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My deep conviction is that nothing extrinsic can ever make you a better person. Or a worse person, for that mater. Being rich won&amp;rsquo;t make you a better person. Being poor won&amp;rsquo;t either. Believing in God won&amp;rsquo;t make you a better person. Nor being an atheist. Surviving cancer or becoming terminally ill won&amp;rsquo;t make you a better person. And even helping others won&amp;rsquo;t magically turn you into a better person.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buckwheat pancakes</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buckwheat-pancakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buckwheat-pancakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my favorite recipe for pancakes.

&lt;p>These recipe is gluten-free, but not vegan. And I’m not sure how I would adopt it. Also be warned, your kids are probably not gonna love you anymore after you betray their trust by serving them these on a beautiful Sunday morning.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500g of beef with bones&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3L of water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g of root vegetables (e.g., onion, carrot, parsley root, radish)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g of shredded cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g of beets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>100g of tomates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>300g of potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bay leaf, pepper, salt, herbs to taste&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="method">Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>put the beef in the pot and add water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>simmer for a minimum of 2 hours, add salt after about 1h30m&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cut the root vegetables into 10mm cubes and sauté in vegetable oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>separately sauté shredded cabbage until soft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>coarsely grate the beets and sauté for 15-20 minutes, until fully cooked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>blanche the tomatoes, cut them into pieces, and sauté in vegetable oil for 10-15 minutes on low heat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>remove the beef from the pot and filter the broth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then add the sauteed root vegetables and cabbage to the broth and set on medium heat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when it starts to boil again, reduce the heat to simmer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the potatoes cut into 15mm cubes and cook for 10-15 min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the sauteed beets and cook for another 10 min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cut or shred the beef into small-ish pieces and add back to the soup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finally add the sauteed tomatoes, bay leaf, pepper, herbs and the borscht is ready!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>serve with sour cream&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="full-history">Full history&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With Git, every repository contains a full copy of the project history, and no repository is inherently more important than any other.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-addressable">Content-addressable&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Git stores content in files with names that are 40-hexdigit (160-bit) SHA1 hashes. This has some interesting implications. It means for example that Git will never store the same data twice within a repository because identical data would have identical SHA1 hashes and therefore be stored in the same file. It also means that the contents of a Git object will never change because that would change the name the object is stored under.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fitness Proportionate Disk Selection</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is a proposal I made for improving the disk selection algorithm of a distributed file storage system.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="current-disk-selection-algorithm">Current Disk Selection Algorithm&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The current algorithm randomly selects a disk among the top N percent and assigns it to a given equivalence class. This strategy is suboptimal for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Even when there&amp;rsquo;s a great variability of fitness values among the top N percent of the disks, the most suitable disks will have the same probability of being selected as the least suitable disks, thus leading to unbalanced placement. Simply decreasing the value of N is not sufficient to resolve the problem, as it is always possible to have a situation when the fitness variability is great regardless of how small the N is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When nearly all disks in the pool have similar fitness values, they all deserve equal chance, yet only the top N percent will be considered. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to assume that the next round of placements will favor a different set of disks. But the selection of the next eligible set is determined by the weights that each fitness parameter is assigned. And it is possible that the same group of disks will be used for placement for a while, thus, once again, leading to unbalanced placement.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Undoubtedly, we would like to preserve some randomness in the selection algorithm to minimize the chances of overwhelming the same disks and nodes with placements and IO. But for reasons stated above, a fitness proportionate selection algorithm is more desirable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rock climbing lessons</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dont-give-up">Don&amp;rsquo;t give up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&amp;rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&amp;rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there. If you are persistent and don&amp;rsquo;t give up, you sooner or later find your groove and come on top victorious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rock climbing First-Aid kit</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rock-climbing-first-aid-kit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rock-climbing-first-aid-kit/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> I’m not a doctor, yadda-yadda-yadda. Simply having a first-aid kit in your pack is neither going to keep you safe, nor magically save somebody’s life if you have no idea how to use it. If you climb outdoors, do yourself a favor and take a Wilderness First Aid or a similar class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you’re going to find yourself in. If you’re not qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there’s no need to bring the implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a problem on an ice climbing trip.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kids' activity tower</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/activity-tower/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 May 2012 12:00:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/activity-tower/</guid><description>&lt;p>On January 1st, 2012 I sketched an idea—an activity tower for my yet to be born son.

&lt;p>This article outlines my setup and workflow for writing documents using &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc&lt;/a>. This is a workflow that I personally find natural and convenient. There are some very important limitations (discussed below), but I&amp;rsquo;ve been successfully using this workflow for quite some time and it seems to be working great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Main requirements for my workflow were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>plain text editing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>keeping track of multiple revisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>collaboration with multiple simultaneous remote and offline authors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>support for multiple target output formats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>automated publishing (through an external build system and such)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="limitations">Limitations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Note that publishing is a one-way process in this workflow. If you publish on a Wiki, then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to find a way to pull the changes from Wiki back into your &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; document. I&amp;rsquo;m using Git-MediaWiki bridge to publish/update articles to/from our corporate wiki. I&amp;rsquo;ve also looked into replacing MediaWiki with gitit which uses Git as a backend and therefore would have allowed me to push/pull to it directly, but presently the feature set is not complete enough to be a viable replacement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turtles in my navel</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/turtles-in-my-navel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2010 12:29:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/turtles-in-my-navel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Turtles in my navel are having an argument: “It’s not my turn to take out the trash,” hisses Greg, “why do you insist that it is?” A vein on his right temple is pulsing a steady 60 beats per minute; he manages to stay mostly calm – he loves Patricia, after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sun just popped up from behind my left breast. The snails of the morning chill are chased away by the spreading beams of warmth. I’m getting hungry and the turtles in my navel are getting louder. “It’s always your turn, you lazy git,” screeches Patricia – they are having this argument almost every morning. Greg and Patricia are in their late sixties and have lived together for at least forty years. This routine is so efficient by now that it doesn’t distract them from their other morning rituals. Patricia is chopping mushrooms on their tiny kitchen table, precariously perched on the northern slope of my navel, while Greg is sitting at the opposite side of the table hiding behind his newspaper. Across the navel, in a big greasy wok, snails are sizzling with anticipation. “So, do you want your breakfast or not?” — Patricia is unrelenting, and Greg is getting up to take out the trash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cherry Garcia ice cream</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/cherry-garcia-ice-cream-recipe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2010 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/cherry-garcia-ice-cream-recipe/</guid><description>&lt;p>I made this recipe a number of times and the results are always excellent!&lt;/p>

&lt;li>1 cup whole milk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup crushed dark chocolate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup fresh cherries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="method">Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Place the crushed chocolate (tiny solid chunks taste better than shaved flakes which tend to soften or even dissolve) and the pitted and halved cherries (you can use canned cherries, but make sure to drain and dry them first) in separate bowls and refrigerate for a few hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and stir until almost ready.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>About 5 minutes before the ice cream is ready, add the chocolate and the cherries, then continue stirring until the ice cream becomes stiff.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transfer into a storage container and place in the freezer for a few hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="yield">Yield&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This recipe make just over &lt;strong>1 quart&lt;/strong> of delicious ice cream depending on the size of the eggs and the amount of chocolate and cherries. I always get too greedy with the fillings, but can you blame me?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dvorak, progress update</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/dvorak-progress-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2006 16:18:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/dvorak-progress-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been six months since I switched to Dvorak.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 package of fresh salmon from Costco (approx. $11) sans 5 &amp;rsquo;tail&amp;rsquo; inches&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 jar of kosher flake salt from Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s (about 75 grams)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tbsp assorted whole pepper (black, white, whatever)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bay leaf ad libitum&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="method">Method&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Cut the pieces of salmon in half, wash them and dry with paper towels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rub some salt into salmon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sprinkle some salt and peppers on the bottom of the pot, and lay the first piece of salmon flat in the pot. Take some peppers and press them into the salmon, then sprinkle some salt as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place the remaining pieces on top of each other, repeating the procedure with pepper and salt. You should use up all the salt and pepper by the end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place a saucer or a small plate on top of the salmon stack, and put some weight on it (half a gallon of water in a container will do just fine).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let the pot stand uncovered on the kitchen counter for half a day at room temperature and then move it still uncovered to the fridge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In another 36 hours the salmon is ready to be served and enjoyed with your favorite brand of Czech beer!&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Programming for the Palm OS platform has a very distinct &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;rdquo; smell to it. Memory management is a mess, supporting different screen resolutions is a major pain in the butt, and instead of a real file system developers have to deal with this stupid notion that everything is a database. There might have been reasons for it a few years ago but not anymore. And Palm fails to recognize this fact and deal with it appropriately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A little bad poetry</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2004 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen).

&lt;p>Подобно солнечному лучу, символ прорезывает все планы бытия и все сферы сознания и знаменует в каждом плане иные сущности, исполняет в каждой сфере иное назначение.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Символика — система символов; символизм — искусство, основанное на символах. Оно вполне утверждает свой принцип, когда разоблачает сознанию вещи, как символы, а символы как мифы.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>В искусстве, как и везде, можно проследить влияние двух начал: мужского и женского. Женское, рецептивное — реализм и мужское, инициативное — идеализм.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Весна</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/spring/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 1995 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/spring/</guid><description>&lt;p>Фьюить-птица! Звонок! Трамвай! Перескакиваю сайгаком через лужи, наполовину заполненные трамвайными рельсами. Шум, гвалт! Люди бегут, ручьи текут. Все подчиняется вечному закону наступательного движения. Из-под снега пробивается трава. Деревья еще не распустились. Чего не скажешь о женщинах.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Остановился, задумался. Хорошо!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Отряхиваю пыль с плеч, с груди, с ног, с волос. Расправляю крылья, дышу. Свежо! Уа-уа! У-лю-лю! Фьюить!..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Звонок, трамвай, сайгаком по лужам, трава, ноги, волосы, люди, ручьи&amp;hellip; Несет меня. Впадаю в океан&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Миссия Будды</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buddha/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 1995 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buddha/</guid><description>&lt;p>В историческом аспекте буддизм есть наиболее важная религия, хотя он не является таковой в аспекте философском. Это самое большое религиозное движение, гигантская духовная волна. Нет ни одной цивилизации, которая не ощутила бы на себе влияния буддизма.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Чтобы постичь суть учения Будды, нужно знать, что за события творились в Индии в тот момент. Необходимо понять, что представляло из себя индийское общество, когда индийская цивилизация достигла наивысшего расцвета. Легко заметить, что индийская цивилизация погибала и возрождалась неоднократно. В этом и состоит ее исключительность. Народ Индии, который превыше всего ценит мир, погружается в пучину упадка, но в последствии возрождается снова. Блаженны миротворцы, ибо их ждет радость на земле!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Розовое солнышко</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rose-sun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 1987 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rose-sun/</guid><description>&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>— 1987 —

Розовое солнышко
На твоих губах
Голубая даль в глазах
Золото в перстах

Ну а я, соколик,
Высоко лечу
Даль и солнце с золотом
Разом отхвачу
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item></channel></rss>
