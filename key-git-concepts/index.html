Key Git Concepts &ndash; George Sudarkoff</title></head><body><h1>Key Git Concepts</h1><p>#Key Git concepts</p><p>Understanding a few key concepts will help you make sense of how Git works and how to use it effectively.</p><h2 id=full-history>Full history</h2><p>With Git, every repository contains a full copy of the project history, and no repository is inherently more important than any other.</p><h2 id=content-addressable>Content-addressable</h2><p>Git stores content in files with names that are 40-hexdigit (160-bit) SHA1 hashes. This has some interesting implications. It means for example that Git will never store the same data twice within a repository because identical data would have identical SHA1 hashes and therefore be stored in the same file. It also means that the contents of a Git object will never change because that would change the name the object is stored under.</p><p>Git objects are unique across all repositories, not just your repository. You can add objects from any repository to your repository, and as long as the imported objects represent data different from data in your repository, they will never collide with any of your objects. The SHA1 object names derived from the data ensure that all stored content is truly unique.</p><p>It may help to note that the object store has a single namespace for all objects, which are stored in the &ldquo;.git/objects/&rdquo; subdirectory of your repository. But there is no danger of namespace collision when storing two objects representing different data because of the data uniqueness enforced by the SHA1 naming scheme.</p><p>Some Git objects represent files, while others represent collections of files. The SHA1 object naming scheme also ensures that objects representing different hierarchies of files and directories also have unique object names. So, you can add objects representing whole trees of files from other repositories to your repository. And none of those objects will overwrite objects in your repository unless they represent the same tree or file (in which case no information would be lost anyway).</p><h2 id=types-of-objects>Types of objects</h2><p>Four kinds of objects are stored in a Git repository: blobs, trees, commits, and tags. Blob objects contain binary data and are used to store all file content. Tree objects represent a single directory. Commit objects contain a &lsquo;commit&rsquo; message and one or more tree names and their SHA1 hashes, indicating how the tree objects are related. Tag objects represent a starting point in the object store.</p><p>A file of data is stored in a blob object that is named after the SHA1 hash of its contents. The file name itself is stored separately in a tree object, paired with the SHA1 hash of the file data. A tree object stores the name and SHA1 hash of every file within a directory. It also stores the SHA1 hash of other tree objects that represent subdirectories. So, a tree object is a kind of directory within the object store.</p><p>Through the magic of SHA1 hashes, tree objects represent not just a single directory of files, but an entire hierarchy rooted at a directory. Likewise, a commit object represents a history of a hierarchy. To see how that works, suppose someone changes the contents of a file deep inside the hierarchy represented by a commit object. That will change the SHA1 hash of the edited file and result in a new blob object in the object store. That new SHA1 value will obviously not appear in the tree object associated with the original file. The entire chain of objects leading back to the commit object will remain as before. The edited file is a new blob object, and the original commit still represents the state of the hierarchy as it was before the file changed.</p><p>A similar effect happens when tree objects are changed. Say a file is added to a directory. The tree object corresponding to that directory will now have an additional entry. That causes the SHA1 hash for the tree object itself to change. So, a new tree object has been created in the object store with a new SHA1 hash for its name. The original tree object remains the same as it was before the new file was added. All objects linked back to the commit object remain unchanged. The history has been preserved.</p><p>A tag object is the starting point for entering the object store. The actual files in that state consist of whatever blob objects are reachable from the starting tag object.</p><h1 id=how-does-this-actually-work>How does this actually work?</h1><p>The basic ideas described above can be illustrated easily. The following examples, though somewhat simplified, show in some detail what happens during some simple interactions with a mock repository. You are invited to follow along with the examples in a Unix shell.</p><p>Start with a couple of text files in a directory:</p><p>$ mkdir d1
$ echo &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; >d1/f1
$ echo &ldquo;Today is Friday.&rdquo; >d1/f2</p><p>Build the initial object store from these files. Blob objects will contain the data from the files. In addition, there will be a tree object to represent the directory, and a commit object to represent the initial history of the <strong>d1/</strong> hierarchy:</p><p>$ mkdir objects
