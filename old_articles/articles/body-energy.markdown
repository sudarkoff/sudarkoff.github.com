I am not the first one to think of this obviously (Matrix movie was partly about that), but how about powering our electronic toys with the energy produced by our own bodies? It'll burn additional calories of course, but maybe we'll even solve the obesity problem along the way. Just don't talk on your phone for too long or you'll starve. Running out of juice will take on a whole new meaning. With all the miniaturization and the onset of the embeddable devices, surely some research should have been done in this area already.
