Little did I know when I was riding a 10-mile test drive on my new road bike yesterday that my butt will be hurting like a bitch afterwards. My legs were fine, my cardiovascular system didn't even blink, but my butt was absolutely unprepared for the experience! Today I had my rear end suspended in the air for the whole ride to work. And it's a good thing I live only a mile from the office! No doubt I will be buying one of those gel-padded pants shortly.
