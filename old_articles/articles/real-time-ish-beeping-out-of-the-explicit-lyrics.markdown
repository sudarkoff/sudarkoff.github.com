Title: Real-time(-ish) beeping out of the explicit lyrics

Would it be nice if you could push a button on your Walkman (or whatever
kids are listening to their tunes on nowadays) and turn the songs into
their clean versions automagically without having to download (if you’re
a listener) and distribute (if you’re a publisher) multiple versions of
the same tracks? (Thanks for keeping me company till the very end of
that sentence!)

Since even the actual Walkman is now a **digital** music player, you
don’t even need to bake any complex functionality into the player
itself. The publisher would just embed the tags marking the explicit
parts of a song in the track itself. The Walkman then would see a
"dirty word" and mute the sound - Bob’s your uncle!
