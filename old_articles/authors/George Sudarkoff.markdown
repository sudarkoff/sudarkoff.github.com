Hello, my name is George. The name origin is Greek (Γεώργιος) and it means "farmer": Γεώ – "earth", εργο – "to work". In Russian, which is my native language, it is Георгий (or Гоша, Жора and even Егор)—can you tell that Cyrillic alphabet was derived from Greek? But my russian friends call me Yura (Юра) or Yuri (Юрий)—it is much shorter, easier to pronounce and that is what I have in my Russian passport too. In Japanese, Yuri (ユリ) means "lily" and is often used to refer to all things lesbian.

I am a software developer by trade. Since the early nineties I’ve been writing software professionally and nowadays I enjoy it more than ever, because many more things are possible. I have a full time job at a small storage virtualization startup and I also do various projects on the side. Often, my side projects are related to my hobbies, which include electronics, ham radio, rock climbing, running, biking, yoga, cooking, playing musical instruments, writing, making physical things and various other pursuits.
