### About

This is a personal blog of [George Sudarkoff][] (that's me). I write about technology, electronics, psychology, rock climbing and whatever else might be on my radar at any given moment. Profound thoughts could be found in the "[Profound](/dev/null)" section of the blog.

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][].
