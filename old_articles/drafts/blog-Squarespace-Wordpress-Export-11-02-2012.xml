      <title>Markdown + Pandoc Workflow</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/26/markdown-pandoc-workflow</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<p>This article outlines my setup and workflow for writing documents using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. This is a workflow that I personally find natural and convenient. There are some very important limitations (discussed below), but I've been successfully using this workflow for quite some time and it seems to be working great.</p>

<p>Main requirements for my workflow were:</p>

<ul>
<li>plain text editing</li>
<li>keeping track of multiple revisions</li>
<li>collaboration with multiple simultaneous remote and offline authors</li>
<li>support for multiple target output formats</li>
<li>automated publishing (through an external build system and such)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Note that publishing is a one-way process in this workflow. If you publish on a Wiki, then you'll need to find a way to pull the changes from Wiki back into your "source" document. I'm using <a href="https://github.com/Bibzball/Git-Mediawiki">Git-MediaWiki</a> bridge to publish/update articles to/from our corporate wiki. I've also looked into replacing MediaWiki with <a href="http://gitit.net/">gitit</a> which uses Git as a backend and therefore would have allowed me to push/pull to it directly, but presently the feature set is not complete enough to be a viable replacement. </p>

<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>

<p>A lot of the pieces of this workflow are not strictly necessary - you can launch any text editor and start typing. And when you're done typing, execute pandoc directly to convert your Markdown text to a fancy document (PDF, Word, HTML). The workflow I present here supports more complex scenarios like writing large multipart documents (potentially multilingual), collaborating with multiple (potentially remote and offline) authors simultaneously and generating multiple output formats of the final document with a single command. </p>

<h2 id="scm">SCM</h2>

<p>The first component of my workflow is an SCM. I happen to prefer <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, but any reasonable SCM will do. Anything and everything related to the document I'm working on is version-controlled. That includes an outline, notes, images, supporting scripts and so on. This allows me to focus on my writing and not worry about keeping track of multiple revisions, making a backup copy, merging multiple versions of the document and so on. It also allows me to evolve the accompanying tools (Makefiles, scripts, etc.) along with the document. Git in particular makes collaboration with multiple authors dramatically easier - authors work on their pieces in their own repositories and/or branches without stepping on each other's toes and then gracefully merge everything back together.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>Once again, I happen to prefer <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, but any reasonable editor would do (e.g.: <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on Mac, <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gEdit</a> on Linux or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> on Windows).</p>

<p>Some text editors are better than others. Particular Vim features (extended by a few strategically picked plugins) that would make your writing more pleasant include automatic indenting of lines in a certain way, inserting matching brackets for links, syntax highlighting, not slowing me down when working remotely through a slow internet connection (which happens more often that I'd like) and so on.</p>

<p>For formatting the text I use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> - my first secret ingredient. It is a plain text formatting syntax and as the author himself puts it: "the overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions." And it's a very important feature because, once again, it allows me to focus on my writing rather than on formatting the text. Markdown is easy and unobtrusive to write and it doesn't get in the way when you read the document. At the same time, it's easily convertible to a plethora of fancier-looking formats. Which brings us to the next tool - Pandoc.</p>

<h2 id="pandoc">Pandoc</h2>

<p><a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> is the second secret ingredient. It takes Markdown (in addition to a half dozen other formats) and converts it to a couple dozen other formats including HTML, Microsoft Word, PDF, EPUB and MediaWiki. Pandoc also introduces a few important extensions to Markdown that make it even easier to write content-rich documents. And all in plain text!</p>

<h2 id="makefile">Makefile</h2>

<p>Sure, you can just execute pandoc directly from the command line, but if your document consists of a couple dozen chapters and you need to convert it to half a dozen formats, then managing it by hand becomes quite difficult. Again, make is a tool that was designed specifically to take a potentially very large collection of text files and produce a single (binary) file. If Makefile sounds like a little too much, it could easily be replaced by a batch/shell script that does the same thing just a bit less efficiently.</p>

<p>Notice that almost all the tools I mention are designed to work with the source code. This is an important moment because although Markdown is a fine format on its own and you might never actually even bother converting it to any other format (many publishing tools accept Markdown as is and convert it on the fly), for as long as your document is a work in progress, it is essentially no different than a source code of a program - you write and rewrite various parts of the work, you try out ideas, merge multiple revisions together, review the history of edits and so on. Using the software development tools makes sense. Especially if you're already familiar with them.</p>

<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives?</h1>

<p><strong>What about Google Docs?</strong> It's an okay editor that saves you from having to install Microsoft Office (or OpenOffice.org). It keeps the history of edits and even allows you to collaborate with multiple authors. However, let's be honest, it's not the editor you'd use normally and it suffers from a few shortcomings. The formatting is very fragile and tends to implode if you move the text around or paste fragments from other sources. The offline mode is very limited. And it's very difficult to convert the document to any other format.</p>

<p><strong>What about Wiki?</strong> Wiki is a great publishing platform and it does keep the history of edits. But it is an even worse editor than Google Docs, it typically has no offline mode and does not allow simultaneous edits. It is also most probably not available outside of your company network making it difficult to work disconnected.</p>

<p><strong>But Git, Vim and Makefiles, really?!</strong> Okay, you got me there. I admit, this stuff is pretty nerdy and I don't have a very good defense here. If you're a marketing person, you're not going to learn how to write Makefiles just to implement my workflow. If you're a software engineer, however, these (or similar) are the tools you're using every day anyway. And even if you're a sales guy, you can still use the Notepad to write a Markdown-formatted document, convert it into a nicely formatted document using Pandoc and forget about all that git-shmit mumbo-jumbo.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<p>The following text fragment is a Markdown-formatted first section of this article.</p>

<pre><code># Requirements

This article outlines my setup and workflow for writing
documents using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) 
and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). This is 
a workflow that I personally find natural and convenient. 
There are some very important limitations (discussed 
below), but I've been successfully using this workflow 
for quite some time and it seems to be working great.

Main requirements for my workflow were:

-   plain text editing
-   keeping track of multiple revisions
-   collaboration with multiple simultaneous remote and 
    offline authors
-   support for multiple target output formats
-   automated publishing (through an external build 
    system and such)
</code></pre>

<p>Makefile could be as <a href="https://gist.github.com/3956724">complex</a> or as simple as you desire. The following is an example of a fairly trivial one:</p>

<pre><code>%.html: %.md style.css
    pandoc -c style.css -o $@ $&lt;

%.docx: %.md
    pandoc -o $@ $&lt;

%.pdf: %.md
    pandoc -o $@ $&lt;

all: doc.html doc.docx doc.pdf
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Interviewing Engineers</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/8/21/interviewing-engineers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been on both sides of the technical interview process for over two decades now - most recently just a couple of weeks ago - and I have a few thoughts I wanted to share.</p>

<h2 id="tipsfortheinterviewee">Tips for the interviewEE</h2>

<p><strong>Talk</strong> Talk a lot and do not stop. The more you talk, the more likely it is you're talking about something you're very familiar with and the less time the interviewER has to quiz you about things you know nothing about.</p>

<p>But do not ramble. Rambling looks bad. Rambling means you're not talking about the topics you're familiar with and is usually interrupted with requests for clarification from the interiviewER ("— What the heck are you talking about, man?")</p>

<p><strong>Practice</strong> Of course, if you want to be able to talk for hours about your favorite topics, you'll need to practice a lot. Have a friendly banter with colleagues, go to conferences and read a lot.</p>

<p>If you're going to be writing code on the whiteboard, you should practice that too. It's different from coding on a computer, so a little bit of practice will help.</p>

<p><strong>Be honest</strong> If your interviewER is good, she won't let you talk about your favorite topics unchecked. Sooner or later you'll be asked a question you don't know the answer to. Be honest and say so. Trust me, if your interviewER is asking you a question, she most probably knows the subject pretty well and will be able to tell whether you're winging it. Just say — "I don't know the answer to this question, but…"</p>

<p><strong>Think</strong> "…but let me think for a second and see if I can come up with an answer."</p>

<p>There is a tendency to treat a technical interview as a quiz: "have you ever used blah?", "what's the system call for blah?" Sure, some companies and interviewERs do that, but you probably don't want to work for them anyway. And the ability to come up with an answer to a novel problem is far more valuable than having a previous experience with a particular technology (that is probably going to be obsolete in a couple of years anyway).</p>

<p>Don't be a fool, though, and learn the basics well. What's the Big-O of the quick-sort? Worst case? Can you sort a sequence in O(n) time?</p>

<h2 id="tipsfortheinterviewer">Tips for the interviewER</h2>

<p><strong>Be nice</strong> The purpose of the technical interview is not to show your superiority, it's to assess the skills of the person you're interviewing. If the job will require writing code under the gun, then by all means, stress and intimidate the interviewEE. Otherwise, make every effort to create a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere. Stress narrows your vision, creativity requires a playful and relaxed atmosphere. Being an interviewEE is a stressful job as it is, don't make it worse.</p>

<p><strong>Be prepared</strong> So often companies have no clear understanding of the requirements for the position they are trying to fill. Everybody suffers as a result. The interviewERs are confused about what to ask and how to asses the skills ("He has no idea what <code>if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]</code> means, we can't hire him for the Junior Visual Basic position!"). The interviewEEs get random, disjointed and sometimes repeating questions.</p>

<p>Talk to other interviewERs ahead of time, make sure you have a common strategy for the interview.</p>

<p>Interviewing people is a skill. Just because you're an awesome engineer yourself, does not mean you know how to assess other engineers' abilities. Read a book, take a class. Don't try to wing it - it's disrespectful to everybody involved and leads to poor results.</p>

<p>The best (both challenging and rewarding) technical interview I've ever had was at Amazon. It was a full-day interview - I've seen at least six people that day. And each next interviewER was building on the subjects covered by the previous interviewERs. There was some designing, some coding, and a lot of talking about it all.</p>

<p><strong>Listen</strong> Do not interrupt unless to ask for clarifications. Give interviewEE a chance to explain themselves. If it sounds like the interviewEE is going in the wrong direction or you're not sure you understand the answer (or even think the answer is incorrect) - ask a clarifying question, do not assume the worst automatically. Ask questions with the intention of understanding, not sinking the interviewEE.</p>

<p><strong>Keep an open mind</strong> Would you rather have a team of engineers with diverse experience, combined covering a vast amount of knowledge? Or would you prefer to work with a bunch of clones of yourself? Do not structure your interview as a quiz. Allow an interviewEE to show you what they've got. They might not have an answer to the exact question you're asking, but maybe they have a better solution. Talk about things, see how your interviewEE thinks. Hire a team member, not an automaton capable of performing a predefined limited number of tasks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Rock Climbing First-Aid Kit</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/6/26/rock-climbing-first-aid-kit.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’m not a doctor, yadda-yadda-yadda. Simply having a first-aid kit in your pack is neither going to keep you safe, nor magically save somebody’s life if you have no idea how to use it. If you climb outdoors, do yourself a favor and take a Wilderness First Aid or a similar class.</em></p><p>First of all, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you’re going to find yourself in. If you’re not qualified to perform a cricothyrotomy, then there’s no need to bring the implements. Likewise, heat exhaustion is probably not going to be a problem on an ice climbing trip.</p><p>Second, rock climbing injuries are typically the result of a fall and therefore I am only going to focus on traumatic injuries. I would recommend taking a Wilderness First Aid class if you want to learn more about non-traumatic injuries - they are not obvious to diagnose and treat.</p><p>The things that can go wrong in a fall include spinal injuries, head trauma, bone fractures, muscle and tendon tears, skin lacerations, joint dislocations, sprains, abrasions, burns, blisters, and so on. If all this makes you dizzy - either stay at home or find a friend willing to save your ass if it comes to it.</p><p>Spinal and head injuries require rapid evacuation and there’s very little you can do to help your patient - backboards and head immobilization devices are bulky and therefore you’re unlikely to carry them with you on a climbing trip. Compound fractures, deep lacerations and crush wounds also require immediate evacuation. However, you should be able to stop the bleeding, dress the wounds and splint an injured limb before the help arrives. Some joint dislocations could be reduced in the field (e.g.: shoulder or finger), other would require qualified help and in some cases specialized equipment - immobilize with a splint and evacuate. Finally, sprains, abrasions, rope burns and flappers could be treated in the field with a few simple supplies.</p><p>Here’s an approximate list of items for a <em>climbing-specific first aid kit</em>:</p><ul>
<li>Non-latex surgical gloves</li>
<li>Assortment of sterile wound dressings, bandages and gauzes</li>
<li>Triangular bandages with a few safety pins</li>
<li>Universal aluminum splint (SAM or wire mesh)</li>
<li>Assortment of bandaids</li>
<li>Blister treatment</li>
<li>Alcohol wipes</li>
<li>Antibiotic ointment</li>
<li>Adhesive tape</li>
<li>Pain killers</li>
<li>Tweezers</li>
<li>Ice pack</li>
<li>Heat pad</li>
<li>Mylar rescue blanket</li>
<li>Notepad and pencil</li>

      <title>Camping with the baby, take 1</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/5/24/camping-with-the-baby-take-1.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We took our String Bean camping for the first time a couple of weeks ago, this article is a short account of what worked and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I combed the web for tips on camping with an infant a couple of weeks before the trip and based on what I found, I put together an <a href="http://www.packwhiz.com/l/12317763/camping-with-an-infant">infant-specific camping packing list</a>. Since then, I added a couple of extra items to the list, but for the most part it was pretty spot-on.</p>

<h3>What worked well</h3>

<p><strong>Disposable bottle liners.</strong> These things worked extremely well. I couldn&#8217;t imagine washing the bottles after each meal even with the bathroom just a few strides away. And in the backcountry, that would be even more problematic. With liners, you just trash the liner, replace the nipple with the fresh one and put the used one in a ziplock. Then at the end of the day, boil used nipples and voila - they are ready to be used again next day.</p>

<p><strong>Pop-up tent.</strong> We own a Kidco Peapod and it worked pretty well for us. But we would never leave our child unattended in that tent due to a recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BD5G9DP7PKLG/ref=cm_pdp_rev_more?ie=UTF8&amp;sort_by=MostRecentReview#R27EAWSOT40M2Z">infant death</a>.</p>

<h3>What could have worked better</h3>

<p><strong>Tent.</strong> Crawling on elbows and knees inside our 3-person backpacking tent while holding the Bean was not fun. It&#8217;s not terrible, but for car camping outings we bought a proper family size tent immediately after returning from this trip.</p>

<h3>What didn&#8217;t work at all</h3>

<p><strong>Sleeping.</strong> Originally, we planned to put a mattress from Bean&#8217;s co-sleeper in between us atop our two-person sleeping bag. That did not work <em>at all</em> - there was not enough room left inside the bag for two people. So we had to separate the sleeping bag into two and lay the co-sleeper mattress on a sleeping pad between us. That worked fairly well and we are planning to stick with this method for our next trip.</p>

<h3>What we didn&#8217;t end up using</h3>

<p><strong>Umbrella.</strong> We camped in a shady spot and it hasn&#8217;t rained, so we did not need to use an umbrella. But I do still believe that it&#8217;s a good sun or rain protection for the Bean.</p>

<p><strong>Stroller.</strong> I don&#8217;t believe we even packed the stroller for this trip. We will, however, bring it on our next trip. It&#8217;s one of the B.O.B.&#8217;s, with great suspension, an adapter for the infant car seat and excellent all-terrain wheels. It would probably work well on longer approaches with lots of climbing gear in both our packs. But we&#8217;ll see if it actually works in a couple of days when we camp in Yosemite.</p>

<h3>What we wish we brought along</h3>

<p><strong>Battery-operated baby monitor.</strong> The first night of camping I rocked the Bean to sleep, put him in the tent, zipped it up, made two steps away and suddenly realized that there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to hear him cry if he wakes up - went back and picked him up from the tent. A monitor would have been real handy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2012/5/16/real-time-ish-beeping-out-of-the-explicit-lyrics.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would it be nice if you could push a button on your Walkman (or whatever kids are listening to their tunes on nowadays) and turn the songs into their clean versions automagically without having to download (if you&#8217;re a listener) and distribute (if you&#8217;re a publisher) multiple versions of the same tracks? (Thanks for keeping me company till the very end of that sentence!)</p>

<p>Since even the actual Walkman is now a <strong>digital</strong> music player, you don&#8217;t even need to bake any complex functionality into the player itself. The publisher would just embed the tags marking the explicit parts of a song in the track itself. The Walkman then would see a &lt;explicit&gt;dirty word&lt;/explicit&gt; and mute the sound - Bob&#8217;s your uncle!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Home Automation</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/7/17/home-automation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was always intrigued by the idea of automating the routine parts of my life. Over the years, I looked at different technologies and approaches, but I couldn’t find an approach that would be both simple and cheap and open to tinkering. Finally, thanks to a colleague, I discovered&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>&nbsp;- an awesome platform supplemented by a lively community of makers. I have quite a few projects in the works and I’m going to post the details here.</p><p>Some relevant links:&nbsp;<a href="https://sud.to/tag/arduino/">arduino</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://sud.to/tag/electronics/">electronics</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://sud.to/tag/homeautomation/">home automation</a>.</p><h3>X10 Motion+Light Sensor</h3><p>This was my very first Arduino project. It’s still working off of a breadboard and is still controlling lights in my home office. Some day I’m gonna replace X10 with XBee and build a bunch of these to place all around the house.</p><h3>Attic Fan Thermostat</h3><p>This is my first big project related to Home Automation. There are two sensors on the thermostat - temperature and relative humidity. The thermostat can work either completely autonomously - monitor and broadcast sensor readings and control the fan appropriately. Alternatively, it can pass control to my home automation system (via ZigBee wireless mesh network) which would decide when to turn the fan on based on data it receives from multiple sources. The thermostat sensor data is also dumped to&nbsp;<a href="http://bot.sud.to/datastream/attic1fan_temperature">bot.sud.to</a>&nbsp;for testing and demonstration purposes.</p><h3>Garage Parking Assistant</h3><p>This device serves dual purpose - helps to park perfect distance from the wall every time and feed the car presence data to the home automation system via ZigBee wireless mesh network.</p><h3>Garage Door Sensor/Opener (TODO)</h3><p>This project will consist of four sensors - two for each door in my garage - and two relays to control the doors. It will also share door status and listen to remote commands via ZigBee wireless mesh network.</p><h3>Weather Station (TODO)</h3><p>The goal is to build a complete weather station from scratch. The station will be completely solar powered, will communicate with the home automation system via ZigBee wireless mesh network and will include the following sensors:</p><ul><li>Temperature</li><li>Relative Humidity</li><li>Atmospheric Pressure</li><li>Light Sensor</li><li>Anemometer</li><li>Wind Vane</li><li>Rain Gauge</li></ul><h3>Car Seat Memory (TODO)</h3><p>My Jeep has power seats, but no memory. I think adding a couple of memory buttons should be trivial by using multi-turn pots as position sensors.</p><p>​</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Having more things means losing more things</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/7/25/having-more-things-means-losing-more-things.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this thing for a while - stashing multiple quantities of things I need or want to have handy at different times and in different locations - and I am happy to report that it&#8217;s not only wasteful, but it also doesn&#8217;t work. It sorta works for things like power bricks that are semi-permanently attached to a place (e.g.: you sit on a couch and there is a power cord for your laptop there.) But it doesn&#8217;t work for things like eye glasses, notebooks and headphones. They either slowly all end up in the same place or just get lost one by one - having more things means losing more things.</p>

<p>I remember a tale I&#8217;ve heard as a child. It was about an ancient ruler who decorated his worrier&#8217;s swards and shields with precious stones so they wouldn&#8217;t lose them and leave them behind fleeing a battle field. And that&#8217;s similar to the new approach I&#8217;m testing - acquiring the best pair of eye glasses money can buy and hanging tight to them. This, I noticed, creates a deeper emotional attachment to a thing so I end up carrying it around and caring about it more. And I hope it leads to a less cluttered life - the proverbial &#8220;less is more.&#8221;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, maybe the spoon does exist. But the privacy and freedom - the lack of which people so love to whine about - are neither the state, nor the right. They are both relative conditions proportionate to the amount of fight we put up. We fight harder if we want more and we lose them if we stop paying attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Leaving</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/9/21/leaving.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leaving is never easy. Be it leaving your parents&#8217; house to go to college, or leaving a city your grew up in. It&#8217;s not easy to leave a girlfriend of 1 year or a spouse of 11. And it&#8217;s not easy to move to another country on the opposite side of the globe, with the different language, customs and culture. Leaving is hard and it hurts.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s bittersweet - it&#8217;s the end of something good, but also the beginning of something better. Though regardless of whether it was good or bad, it takes time to adjust to your new life. Time heals all wounds, they say - I suppose it&#8217;s true to a degree. But it always takes work to truly move on. If you&#8217;re lucky, all you need is a good song - &#8220;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&#8221; helped me get over a break up with my girlfriend in college. &#8220;Life goes on, bra,&#8221; I reminded myself, when my spirits took a steep dive. Other times you will go through a painful withdrawal - crying feats and everything.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if the thing you are moving away from was bad and leaving feels more like escape - emigrating from a poor country or divorcing an abusive husband - what you often leave behind and have to mourn for properly is a dream that will never become a reality. Not in that country or with that person, anyway. You might have spent years working on your dream and now it&#8217;s time to move on.</p>

<p>But the new life presents its own challenges. You might find yourself trying to fit your old square ways in your new round life. Keeping an open mind is crucial.</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;re depressed and can&#8217;t see the obvious? Ask for help. A friend who would listen or a professional therapist - if you think you need help, ask for it - that&#8217;s what friends are for.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Buckwheat Pancakes</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/9/17/buckwheat-pancakes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005c76ee4b0a695332229b8/5005d3ece4b0ee36c4627a33/5005dfa3c4aa44899228c744/1342562212019/1000w.jpeg" /><p>This is my favorite recipe for pancakes. I made it a dozen times in the last few months. Please note that ratios are given&nbsp;<strong>by weight</strong>, not volume. Invest in&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/csA7VG">kitchen scale</a>&nbsp;if you’re serious about cooking, they make getting consistent results so much easier.</p><p>Buckwheat pancakes are best enjoyed with honey and hot tea.</p><h3>Ingredients (by weight)</h3><ul><li>1 part organic buckwheat flour</li><li>1 part whole wheat flour</li><li>2 parts 1% low fat milk</li><li>1 part eggs</li><li>1/2 part extra virgin olive oil</li><li>salt and cinnamon to taste</li></ul><h3>Directions</h3><p>Separate egg whites from yokes. Mix yokes with flour, milk, olive oil, salt and cinnamon - don’t overdo it. At this point you should get a pretty thick batter - don’t worry about it. Next, beat the egg whites until you get the nice stiff peaks - this is a very important step, do not skip it. Then gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Make sure you do not to lose too many air bubbles, they are what is going to make your pancakes fluffy and light. Pour 1/4 cup of batter on a lightly oiled pan and cook until ready on medium high heat.</p><h3>Yield</h3><p>If you start with one egg and go from there, you should end up with 4-6 pancakes depending on the size of the egg.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>If only I knew what a sandboy is, I could be that happy.  Side note: Somebody once said that there are two leisure classes in the USA: Those at the top of the income scale, and those at the bottom. This is no longer true, as those at the bottom (and the middle) are now without leisure in a world where the price of the very things needed to survive...the stuff at the top of Mazlov&#39;s hierarchy, are beyond their means. I&#39;m talking about food and shelter.<br/>  53 million Americans are living below the poverty level, and a bunch of them used to be your co-workers and your neighbors. A giant, larger swath are headed there to join them with the next year, as the largest asset most people own: their homes, continue to lose value in a death spiral of devaluation that also continues to feed the death spiral of joblessness. No new homes equals no new construction jobs and no new appliances, carpets, lights, doors, decks and roofs. Therefore, no people to make those things.<br/>   So, the manufacturing sector is also spiraling downwards. The service sector is being rapidly outsourced to India, China and the Philippines, creating the same death spiral there.</p><p>   The traditional function of  Democratic government: to defend and support the citizens of that country...is not happening. No tariffs or laws to create the same in-country advantages that every other country on the earth uses to protects its people&#39;s livelihood. The reasons are complex, but boil down to this:<br/>A small cadre of citizens are getting fabulously wealthy by enabling the two death spirals above....the CEO&#39;s and their executive footmen who seek ways to move service and manufacturing jobs out of the USA, while simultaneously seeking to avoid paying taxes on their fabulous incomes. The Wall Street firms who game the markets to take the dwindling wealth of the middle class, and their new game to exploit local and state tax revenue through the funding of PPP projects..at exorbitant rates of return. And foreign companies (like BP) who get the right to drill our coastlines, and sell fuel to the dwindling buyers here. <br/>  <br/>  These people are happy, and very much so. They&#39;ve bought our Senate, and they&#39;ve convinced our States that we will collapse if they stop &quot;helping&quot; us. </p><p>   We could be happy, like the mythical sandboy, if 50 million of us could get food to eat, a place to live, and some hope that the world our (struggling) children are headed towards isn&#39;t going to be even worse.</p><p>  Happy is only a state of mind when there isn&#39;t actual suffering.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>@Encouraged: I don&#39;t want to delve into a lengthy discussion about our crappy government and what they must and mustn&#39;t do. Governments are always crappy and it&#39;s the <strong>citizens&#39;</strong> job to defend and support themselves. And to make sure their government is not too crappy.</p><p>But happy is <strong>always</strong> a state of mind. How do I know? I grew up in a country where people owned close to nothing. We had whatever stuff our government thought we ought to have, more or less. If you wanted to eat some chicken, your entire family had to stand in line for a few hours and hope the store has enough for everybody. Most people couldn&#39;t afford to buy a dresser, let alone a car or a house. I&#39;ve seen lots of unhappy and quite a few happy people there. Now I live in the States where people can buy more or less anything (it&#39;s all relative, really). And yet I still see lots of unhappy and just a few happy folks. And the difference between happy and unhappy is not the stuff they own, it&#39;s the stuff they think. You can be very happy your family has something to eat each day and you can be really upset your new ferrari is not the right color. The way you feel about something is entirely under your control.</p><p>And then you get up and do your best to fix whatever&#39;s broken. Instead of sitting on your ass and wining about it.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>How To Rock Climb (And Really Enjoy It)</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/9/8/how-to-rock-climb-and-really-enjoy-it.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img border="0" width="373" align="right" alt="First time climbing after the accident" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4973340226_fd1bcd7e4e.jpg" height="500" style="padding:0 0 .75em .75em" /> I'm sitting in a quiet cafe, on the second-floor terrace of the Borders store, sipping italian soda, soaking up the distant sounds of a spicy Mexican band, broken foot propped on a chair. And I can't help but wonder if I'll ever bicycle to work again. Don't get me wrong, I love biking a lot and my gas-hog of a car being totally awesome for outdoors is not so good for a 3-mile daily commute. But being grounded for two months because of a silly accident that didn't involve climbing is just too hard to process. Despite the reasoning being completely broken - an injury is an injury, climbing-related or not I'm still grounded - this is a welcomed turn of mood, however.</p>

<p>I started climbing exactly two years ago and I've never been sidelined by an injury in all this time. I slowly progressed through the grades and was inching in on the coveted 5.12's. The last project I was working on before the accident was a short, negative and pumpy 5.11d. I attempted to redpoint it five or six times and was getting closer to sending it, but I was peeling off the same second-to-last move. The frustration with my lack of progression and inability to learn grew bigger with every failure. Because I was not getting results, I was starting to dread doing something I supposedly loved. How did I get from the shivers of excitement to the dread of anticipating a failure without even noticing it?</p>

<p>A couple of months ago my girlfriend and I visited Squamish - a stellar climbing destination in British Columbia. Fantastic cracks, mind boggling slabs and plentiful bouldering - a dream destination. On our first climbing day we decided to try an unknown crack at the base of the Chief's Bulletheads wall. I didn't know the grade of the route, but but it looked within my range. We swung by the wall, I quickly racked up and Adrienne took me on belay. The first moves were solid and I proceeded to jam a few feet before stopping to place some gear. The crack was dirty and my pro felt sketchy. The next section was too wide for jamming and required a transition from solid secure jamming to strenuous and precarious laybacking. But I kept my feet high and moved past those few feet to a good stance with perfect hand-sized gear placements. But then the following ten feet were too wide for pro and too runout to afford a fall on a slabby wall below. I spent a few minutes getting enough courage to climb that section. But when I reached the next solid hand jam and placed a cam, my enthusiasm evaporated completely - directly above me was a bolt, but the hanger was spinning like an Aspen leaf in a light summer breeze. And the bolt itself was moving quite a bit. This is where I needed to think clearly and I wasn't. All I could think about was how crappy that bolt was. I was picturing myself falling and pilling the bolt out. In a haze of frustration my decision was to place a nut, equalize it with the bolt and lower to the ground, cleaning on the way down. And so I did.</p>

<p>But the bolt was unnecessary - I was sitting in a perfect hand crack with plenty of potential for bombproof gear placements. I just needed to place a couple of pieces and move on to the roof traverse. However, earlier looking at that lengthy traverse from the ground, I decided that if I found it too hard, it would be okay to leave some gear and bail.</p>

<p>So how did a beautiful climb within my range turn into a disappointment so quickly? The answer is simple - it didn't, it was doomed from the start. I made a prediction and then worked hard to make it true. Our mood, our emotions are not created outside of our brains. The way we react to things is influenced by the language we use to think and talk about our experiences. (Have you noticed that great climbers call scary climbs "exciting"?) It's hard to enjoy a dirty crack with insecure stances and sketchy pro. But it's an entirely different experience when you think of the same route as a pristine, adventurous one, with thin gymnastic stances and creative pro. When you fail the same impossible move twenty times in a row - it's no fun. But when you learn something new and interesting about your body and mind every time you fall - you can do it all day long and never get bored or discouraged.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The reasons are plentiful and I might write about some of them later. But one that is relevant here is that I used to spend a significant amount of time writing my posts. I'd dump everything "on paper" in a matter of minutes and then spend the next few days editing the piece. But starting today and until further notice I'm gonna try a new thing - no more editing of any kind. Just a pure unstructured stream of raw and pugly consciousness.]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Early Poems in Russian</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/8/21/early-poems-in-russian.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a bunch of poems I wrote in my teens (all in Russian, sorry). I haven't written a single line of poetry in over a decade, but reading these I feel like I just might start writing again.</p>

<h3>Я произнес твое божественное имя...</h3>

<p><em>1999-Feb-25</em></p>

<pre><code>    Я произнес твое божественное имя
    И прочитал твою улыбку в небесах
    Ты - солнца луч, твое сиянье не остынет
    Ты ветра стон в моих упругих парусах
</code></pre>

<h3>Матрос</h3>

<p><em>1999-Feb-04</em></p>

<pre><code>    Матрос хронически недоползал
    Матрос терялся в сферах томных
    Его прокуренный вокзал
    Кипел толпою монотонной

    Кипел и плавился асфальт
    Сползала к носу бескозырка
    Две сотни ярдов до воды
    Полугнилая роба в дырках

    И ничего, что море спит
    И корабли стоят на рейде
    Еще всего один лишь миг
    И доползет матрос, не сдрейфит

    И доползет, и прокричит
    Катись к чертям бутылка рома
    Матрос за стойкой снова спит
    Пол-жизни длится рейс до дома
</code></pre>

<h3>Маленькая женщина</h3>

<p><em>1998-Dec-10</em></p>

<pre><code>    В каждом движении
                     Стебля
    В каждом вздохе
                     Ветра
    Прячется маленькая
                     Женщина
</code></pre>

<h3>Как холодно...</h3>

<p><em>1995-Dec-18</em></p>

<pre><code>    Как холодно
    Как холодно и пусто
    Грустно
    Тоска зудит бока
    И кажется века она уж длится
    Злится
    Пустая суета!
    Умчаться прочь
    Проститься
    С этим домом, с этой птицей
    Навеки
    Навсегда!
</code></pre>

<h3>Твое лицо...</h3>

<p><em>1995</em></p>

<pre><code>    Твое лицо - 
                Спелый персик
    Оно лишено
              червоточин глаз
    Очень
         Очень скучное лицо
</code></pre>

<h3>Роберт</h3>

<p><em>1995-Feb-23</em></p>

<pre><code>    Я прошу и нет конца просьбам
    Я прошу подать пальто, шапку
    Отварить пельмени или манты
    А она не чешется - ей жалко

    Я прошу который день к ряду
    Я прошу, а на душе слякоть
    Потому что все-равно Роберт
    Не получит ничего, явно!
</code></pre>

<h3>Вставай!</h3>

<p><em>1995-Feb-18</em></p>

<pre><code>    Вставай, конный-пеший,
    Ставить вешки.
    Довольно мешкать
    Да ползать пешкой!
    Вставай, твою мать!
    Аль нечего сказать?
</code></pre>

<h3>Дурочка</h3>

<p><em>1995-Feb-16</em></p>

<pre><code>    Я беспечной дурочкой
    Порхаю в небесах
    Бледная снегурочка
    С елочкой в руках

    Пасмурное солнышко
    Вращаясь в небесах
    Заплело куделю
    В жидких волосах

    Где-же, где-же милый
    С соколом в руке?
    Почему не мчится 
    На лихом коне?

    Почему не дарит
    Розы-лепестки?

    Потому что я пишу
    Бездарные стихи!
</code></pre>

<h3>Повод</h3>

<p><em>1995-Feb-13</em></p>

<pre><code>    Я твержу который день кряду
    Дорогая, на дворе слякоть
    Надевай, пожалуйста, шляпку!
    А она не надевает - бяка!
</code></pre>

<h3>Шум столетий</h3>

<p><em>1995-Feb-13</em></p>

<pre><code>    1. Камень на камень - шум столетий
       Мутный поток несется к обрыву
       Наш корабль разбился в щепки
       Кто-то остался, кто-то - сгинул

    2. Река жизни несется дыбясь
       Бросая волны навстречу ветру
       Порвется любая тугая привязь
       Если мы не верны обету
</code></pre>

<h3>Милый мой друг</h3>

<p><em>1994-Nov-10</em></p>

<pre><code>    Разумеется, милый мой друг,
    Я тебя провожу до моста.
    Разумеется, милый мой, да!
    Чувства выдаст скупая слеза.

    Мое слабое сердце стучит.
    Все стучит, и стучит, и стучит...
    Ничего-то в нем слабого нет.
    Разве песня? И та не молчит.

    Песня-дой, что родилась сама.
    Эту песню пою я тебе.
    Как в реке голубая вода,
    Льется песня само по себе.

    Впрочем, я уже много сказал.
    Уходи, милый друг, уходи.
    Ты пройдешь все земные пути
    И поймешь, что со мной потерял.
</code></pre>

<h3>Очарование</h3>

<p><em>1994-Apr</em></p>

<pre><code>    Очарование - порыв ветра,
    Нежданный гость в тихую погоду,
    Сорвет шляпу и стихнет где-то,
    Оставив нас лицом к заходу...
</code></pre>

<h3>Маленькая девочка</h3>

<p><em>1994-Apr</em></p>

<pre><code>    Маленькая девочка
    С длинною косичкой
    Бегает по берегу
    Брызгает водичкой
    Хлопает в ладоши
    Топает ножкой
    До чего прелестная
    Девочка-хорошка
</code></pre>

<h3>Как жаль...</h3>

<p><em>1994-Feb-24</em></p>

<pre><code>    Как жаль
            Что блеклым словом
                              "красота"
    Я не сумею выразить 
                        любовь
    К оврагу
            К лесу
                  К небу
                        К облакам
    К весне
           К капели
                   К лужам
                          и к тебе...
</code></pre>

<h3>Если звезды...</h3>

<p><em>1994-Feb-16</em></p>

<pre><code>    Если звезды
    Это тончайшие отверстия,
    То какой же силы
    Должен быть свет
    С той стороны одеяла!
</code></pre>

<h3>Река</h3>

<p><em>1994-Feb-15</em></p>

<pre><code>    Река, как кошка, свои бока
    Лижет шершавой волной.
    И, лишь я усну, умоет река
    Звезды одну за одной.
</code></pre>

<h3>Утро, солнце, ветер, птица...</h3>

<p><em>1993-Dec-17</em></p>

<pre><code>    Утро
        солнце
              ветер
                   птица...
    У реки склонюсь напиться
    Пусть меня волною смоет
    Поплыву - неси, водица
</code></pre>

<h3>Предостережение</h3>

<p><em>1993-Sep-08</em></p>

<pre><code>    Остановись,
               лицом поникший червь,
    Глодающий безумство проявлений,
    Страдающий свидетель высших сфер,
    Гармоний сверкающий Офелий.

    Остановись,
               не время отрицать,
    Прерви свою бесцельную дорогу,
    Точи булат - готовься воевать,
    Нести огонь смердящему народу.
</code></pre>

<h3>Россия</h3>

<p><em>1993-Sep-02</em></p>

<pre><code>    Вековых лесов махровая щетина
    Пронзает небо синим глазом.
    Hаследница угасшей Византии
    Сияет неотточенным алмазом.
    Грандиозна, полярна, неповторяема
    Hовых времен мессия.
    Океаном неукротимым вздымается
    Яхонтово-парчевая Россия!
</code></pre>

<h3>Что же такое любовь...</h3>

<p><em>1993-May-08</em></p>

<pre><code>    Hе спать ночами подолгу,
    Бродить по саду,
    Бросаться в воду,
    Hе видеть солнца,
    Hе участвовать в гонке,
    Слышать только "прощай" в догонку,
    Hе видеть,
              Hе слышать,
                     Hе есть и не спать
    И страдать, 
               уходя от вопроса,
    Что же такое любовь...
</code></pre>

<h3>Грация</h3>

<p><em>1993-May-03</em></p>

<pre><code>    В рыданьи Грация,
    (Увы, не на моем граните)
    Лохматость мысли
    Посвятит ветрам.
</code></pre>

<h3>Укол шипом розы</h3>

<p><em>1993-May-03</em></p>

<pre><code>    Кончики пальцев святятся током.
    Касание кисти уносит потоком
    Мысли, желания, белое, черное...
    Время проносится в миг. Заведенное
    Серое облако, черного белое,
    Скачет по небу как оголтелое.
    Тонкие ноги врастают в педали.
    Шар головы небесные дали
    Дикообразом колючих волос
    Скребет оставляя десятки полос...
    Красного цвета липкая жидкость
    Солнце презрев, в небе светится.
    Капает в реки, живность терзая...

    Время кончалось, боль исчезала,
    Переставал давать себя знать
    Укол Шипом Розы...
</code></pre>

<h3>Не спешу...</h3>

<p><em>1993-Apr-27</em></p>

<pre><code>    Не спешу!
    А надо бы?

    Не спешу?
    А надо бы!

    Не спешу,
    А надо бы!

    Не спе...
    А надо было!
</code></pre>

<h3>Женщина</h3>

<p><em>1993-Apr-27</em></p>

<pre><code>    Женщина, тебя одну хочу.
    По поводу тебя икру мечу.
    К тебе одной пути ищу.
    Ты взглядом "раз" - уже лечу.
    Ты пошутила - не ропщу.
    Все одно я получу 
                     чего хочу.
    Вот и молчу.
</code></pre>

<h3>Легко Воспламеняемая Жидкость</h3>

<p><em>1993-Mar-29</em></p>

<pre><code>    Моя кровь -
             элвэжэ
    Tэ вспышки -
             тридцать шесть
    Меня лишь тронь,
             и я уже
    Дышу огнем, 
             вздымаю шерсть...
</code></pre>

<h3>Кавказ</h3>

<p><em>1993-Aug-26</em></p>

<pre><code>    Эта листва меня
    В лоб целует. Я
    Чувствую жар огня

    Плети травы, звеня
    Хлещут ноги коня

    И ветер
           Hа флейте
                    Ушных 
                         раковин
    Фальшивит 
             "Полет шмеля"...
</code></pre>

<h3>Чем жил?</h3>

<p><em>1993-Jun-29</em></p>

<pre><code>    Чем жил?
    Ловил в сосуды
    Своего 
           молчанья капли
    Или грибы любви на спицы
    Hанизывал как чеки...

    Поэтому сошел с ума
             от вздоха птицы
    Упавшего
            цветком
                   в ладонь...

<h3>Кошка</h3>

<p><em>1993-Mar-22</em></p>

<pre><code>    Дождь...
    Влажной
           теплой лапой
    Ступает кошка
                 по карнизу 
                           ощущений
</code></pre>

<h3>Твой сияюще-бледный лик...</h3>

<p><em>1993-Jan</em></p>

<pre><code>    Твой сияюще-бледный лик
    Как луна купается
        в воде моих воспоминаний
    Милая,
        я узнал
               твою обратную сторону
</code></pre>

<h3>Как стать драконом</h3>

<p><em>1992-Nov</em></p>

<pre><code>    Встаньте
          Лицом против ветра
    Дайте
          Огню поглотить сигарету
    Выдох
          Окутает дымом сферу
    Разум
          Оценит дракона
</code></pre>

<h3>Норма</h3>

<p><em>1992-Oct-06</em></p>

<pre><code>    Норма 
         вмещающая вечность...

         Слагающая мифы
    осторожность...

    Дерзость
         объемная как небо...

         Грезящее расцветом
    лето...

    Счастье
         мощенное камнями
         вмещенное огнями...

    Норма...
</code></pre>

<h3>Огненный шар</h3>

<p><em>1992-Aug</em></p>

<pre><code>    Касается гор
    Огненный шар
    Спускается с гор
    Белый пожар
    Готовые видеть
    Чувствуют жар
    Сердца...
</code></pre>

<h3>В зимних сумерках...</h3>

<p><em>1992-Feb-04</em></p>

<pre><code>    В зимних сумерках
    В ладонях бъешся пламенем
    Легким пламенем
    Обжигаешь губы - слепок холода
    Очи черные
    В висках прохожим путником
    Стуком в дверь
    Скрипучих петель говором
    Мимолетной фразой разожгу тебя
    В зимних сумерках
</code></pre>

<h3>В моих карманах...</h3>

<p><em>1991</em></p>

<pre><code>    В моих карманах
                   лишь вода
    Голубая вода
                   теплых морей
    Когда погружаю
                   я руки туда
    Шепчу: "Пусть так
                   будет всегда..."

      <title>Turtles in my navel</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/8/18/turtles-in-my-navel.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turtles in my navel are having an argument: &#8220;It&#8217;s not my turn to take out the trash,&#8221; hisses Greg, &#8220;why do you insist that it is?&#8221; A vein on his right temple is pulsing a steady 60 beats per minute; he manages to stay mostly calm – he loves Patricia, after all.</p>

<p>The sun just popped up from behind my left breast. The snails of the morning chill are chased away by the spreading beams of warmth. I&#8217;m getting hungry and the turtles in my navel are getting louder. &#8220;It&#8217;s always your turn, you lazy git,&#8221; screeches Patricia – they are having this argument almost every morning. Greg and Patricia are in their late sixties and have lived together for at least forty years. This routine is so efficient by now that it doesn&#8217;t distract them from their other morning rituals. Patricia is chopping mushrooms on their tiny kitchen table, precariously perched on the northern slope of my navel, while Greg is sitting at the opposite side of the table hiding behind his newspaper. Across the navel, in a big greasy wok snails are sizzling with anticipation. &#8220;So, do you want your breakfast or not?&#8221; – Patricia is unrelenting and Greg is getting up to take out the trash.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m bored with their argument, so I get out of bed and head to the kitchen too. It&#8217;s a pancakes kind of morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Memorial Day climbing trip to South Lake Tahoe</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/6/30/memorial-day-climbing-trip-to-south-lake-tahoe.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Packing List</h3>
<p>Shameless self-promotion: I used my awesome <a href="http://www.packwhiz.com/">Packwhiz</a> service to generate and customize a <a href="http://www.packwhiz.com/user/sudarkoff/weekend-climbing-trip">packing list</a> for my trip and it made packing a breeze!<br /></p>
<h3>Lover's Leap Campground</h3>
<p>We arrived at Lover's Leap Campground at about 11 a.m. on Saturday. There were no spots left, but someone was about to leave, so we really lucked out!<br /><br /><a title="View 'Our gear' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594897748"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/3594897748_04bfd9f294.jpg" border="0" alt="Our gear" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Gear unloaded at our campsite</em><br /><br /><a title="View 'BBQ Grill and fire ring' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3621014412"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/3621014412_ed4accc8be.jpg" border="0" alt="BBQ Grill and fire ring" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>BBQ Grill and fire ring</em><br /><br />Great amenities - toilets, drinking water, a BBQ grill, a large locking storage bin and even a picnic table on every site! Overnight parking is $10, and there's also free street parking.<br /><br />We set our camp very quickly, had a snack and headed out for our first day of climbing. The weather was wonderful - about 75&deg;F and not a cloud in the sky.<br /></p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>You always hear about some people getting lost in their own backyard, but you never think it could happen to you. We spent more than an hour looking for the trail in the wrong place. We were looking for a "clearing" around the Big Meadow trail parking lot while it was half a mile to the north.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3571773910"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3302/3571773910_d380f7edd8.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Where the $^#@ is this "clearing"?</em><br /><br />Finally Igor, a smart guy, figured out that we were in the wrong place, so we hopped in the car and drove to a small parking area about 0.45 mi to the north from the Big Meadow parking. Just in case, if you find yourself in a similar situation, the trail head coordinates are 38.793950&ordm; N, 119.996265&ordm; W. There we saw that "clearing," the small trail crossing it, etc. We headed down the trail to the creek crossing and then up to Luther Spires.<br /><br /><a title="View 'Creek crossing' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594897598"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3594897598_5208642329.jpg" border="0" alt="Creek crossing" width="500" height="375" /></a><br /><em>Creek crossing</em><br /><br />The approach is quite steep and depending on the size of your pack could take 20 to 30 minutes or even more. Total elevation gain is about 600 feet and the distance is about 0.5 mi.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594088501"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3594088501_873cedd139.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Igor posing. Trademark "ears" on one of the "spires" in the background</em><br /></p>
<h3>Luther Spires</h3>
<p>The trail brings you approximately to the middle of the crag.<br /><br />On day one, we decided to check out the far right side of the crag. First, I set the TR anchor for Leo and Irit so they could climb the <strong>Dog and Grigri, Two Bucks (5.9)</strong> and the adjacent <strong>Hey Y'all, Watch This (5.7)</strong>.<br /><br /><a title="View 'Leo about to climb Dog and Grigri, Two Bucks (5.9)' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3621061082"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2460/3621061082_658bd5ceaa.jpg" border="0" alt="Leo about to climb Dog and Grigri, Two Bucks (5.9)" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Leo about to climb Dog and Grigri, Two Bucks (5.9)</em><br /><br /><a title="View 'Irit ready to belay Leo' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3621060928"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3621060928_c1a2f4db3d.jpg" border="0" alt="Irit ready to belay Leo" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Irit ready to belay Leo</em><br /><br />Then Igor and I moved to the nearby <strong>Beer And A Hotdog, Two Bucks (5.8)</strong> which I on-sighted on lead and Igor flashed on top-rope. Then I sent the adjacent <strong>Cheap Commercial Steak Sauce, Two Fifty (5.10a)</strong> on top-rope and seeing that it was easy, red-pointed it on lead immediately after that. Igor flashed it on top-rope as well. Then I climbed the <strong>Dog and Grigri, Two Bucks (5.9)</strong> on top-rope, took down the TR anchor and that was the end of our day one.<br /><br />On day two, we moved to the left side of the crag. First, we decided to set the TR anchor on <strong>Slab-B (5.7)</strong>. The approach to that route scared me more than the route itself. The route was quite easy (later, when I was taking down the TR anchor, I climbed it in my hiking boots to make it a bit more interesting). I placed a red C4 in the crack to the right to protect the first clip.<br /><br /><a title="View 'Leading Slab-B (5.7)' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594088757"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3588/3594088757_02414b4395.jpg" border="0" alt="Leading Slab-B (5.7)" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Leading Slab-B (5.7) You can see my poor cam placement contributing to a slight rope drag.</em><br /><br />After I set the TR on Slab-B for Leo and Irit, Igor and I moved to <strong>Unnamed Toprope (5.10+)</strong>. We both gave it a go a couple of times, but unfortunately couldn't finish it cleanly this time due to a complete lack of any crack climbing skills. There was one obvious finger jam move there which we couldn't do. Maybe next time.<br /><br /><a title="View 'Unnamed Toprope 5.10+' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3571775086"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2422/3571775086_8bdf1415aa.jpg" border="0" alt="Unnamed Toprope 5.10+" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Unnamed Toprope 5.10+</em><br /><br />Then I top-roped Slab-B in my hiking boots, took down the anchor and we all took a coffee break at the base of our next route. There's nothing like a cup of hot coffee made on a camping stove at the base of a cliff with a breathtaking view!<br /><br /><a title="View 'A breathtaking view of the Big Meadow below' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594089011"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3594089011_c25022c920.jpg" border="0" alt="A breathtaking view of the Big Meadow below" width="500" height="375" /></a><br /><em>A breathtaking view of the Big Meadow below</em><br /><br />After our short break, I tied into the sharp end and went up <strong>Jane Spy (5.7)</strong>. Due to a lengthy runout between the 2nd and the 3rd bolts (~20ft if memory serves) and the low angle of the rock, not on-sighting the route was not an option. Check out the side view of the route, where you can see the ledge which makes falling a bad idea:<br /><br /><a title="View 'Leo is TR'ing Jane Spy (5.7)' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3594896776"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3310/3594896776_62450025b1.jpg" border="0" alt="Leo is TR'ing Jane Spy (5.7)" width="375" height="500" /></a><br /><em>Leo is TR'ing Jane Spy (5.7)</em><br /><br />The view at the top was the best reward! (I wish I had had my camera with me!)<br /><br />After everybody sent the route on top-rope, I climbed it again, took down the anchor and rapped down.<br /><br /><a title="View 'Rapping down from the Jane Spy 5.7 (it's windy!)' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15178141@N00/3570968487"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3589/3570968487_2650c6d17e.jpg" border="0" alt="Rapping down from the Jane Spy 5.7 (it's windy!)" width="500" height="375" /></a><br /><em>Rapping down from Jane Spy 5.7 (it's windy!)</em><br /></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The quality of granite at Luther Spires is superb! Lots of very positive in-cut edges, knobs, jugs, large flakes, etc. Even the smallest crimps feel very solid. But although the granite is very featured, I nonetheless felt the lack of crack climbing skills - something I should definitely work on.<br /><br />The approach  to some routes is scarier than the routes themselves. It makes sense to rope up for some of the scarier approaches.<br /><br />The big runout between the 2nd and the 3rd bolts on Jane Spy 5.7 is quite intimidating (but nothing life-threatening). Leading in general is scarier than at Castle Rock (the only other place I climbed at so far). Grades feel slightly harder as well.<br /><br />Since I was the only one leading on this trip, it was my job setting and taking down the TR anchors. I ended up climbing four times more routes than anyone else - I didn't complain, of course! But we should be moving more efficiently next time.<br /><br />Luther Spires is a great sport climbing destination to which we'll be coming back for sure!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Edge</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/5/10/the-edge.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I experienced <a title="The Edge" href="http://www.lifesongadventures.com/adult-camps/the-edge/">The Edge</a> in May of 2008, and I still remember everything as if it had happened last night. Every time I walk by a cedar tree and catch a whiff of the wood, I am immediately reminded of my solo night that I spent in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sudarkoff/2522649297/">shelter made of cedar bark</a>. I realize that after the Camp I became more aware of the surroundings and began to notice things around me that I failed to see before.</p><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2523472020_96eb2363a1_d.jpg" alt="My shelter for the night."></p><p>The first part of the Camp was very educational and also great fun. We practiced starting a fire, learned how to build a shelter, how to find water and food, and everything else we needed to make our solo night more comfortable. In the meantime, along with the food for thought, we were fed a very nutritious and healthful diet consisting of brown rice, steamed veggies, and loads of fruit and nuts. If you don’t mind me sharing, by the end of the Camp whatever left my body was light brown in color and virtually odorless. I felt amazingly light on my feet and full of energy. Our survival meals were also memorable. Where else could I have learnt that a lizard tastes exactly like chicken? I only wished the little critter had had more meat on its bones!</p><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2522646887_3c39214dbc_d.jpg" alt="Small cooking fire."></p><p>Of course my favorite part of the Camp was the solo night. Let me tell you, there is a huge difference between sleeping in a tent and spending a night lying on a pile of pine needles two feet away from the fire listening to a bear walking by. You see everything around you (well, as much as the night time allows you), you smell everything, you feel the breeze - all of your senses are sharpened by the Edge! By the end, I felt empowered and confident of my ability to survive in the wilderness. But boy, did I appreciate every ounce of the four huge Angus beef burgers that I devoured at the feast following our solo night! I am very grateful to Mark and Celeste for everything, and I can’t wait to join them for another adventure!</p><h5>Links</h5><ul>

      <title>Trackpad as a Graphics Tablet</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/11/2/trackpad-as-a-graphics-tablet.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be pretty cool if you could use the trackpad on your laptop as a mini graphics tablet. Perhaps, with a special pen that enables this mode. It probably wouldn't meet the needs of professional graphics designers, but would be pretty useful for quick sketches, diagrams and whatnot. A pen is still the most natural tool for free-form input, so I am fairly positive that this feature will be appreciated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>SOG SEAL Pup Elite Review</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/27/sog-seal-pup-elite-review.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sogknives.com/store/E37.html">SEAL Pup Elite</a> has a very cool-looking 4.85"-long full tang blade with a spine rasp and an injection-molded glass handle with deep comfortable finger grooves that make the handle sit very comfortably in your hand. This knife is available with both partially serrated and straight blades - I personally prefer the straight edge. Its weight and blade thickness feel just right and overall the knife feels very solid.</p><br/><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sudarkoff/2980548020/" title="SOG SEAL Pup Elite"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2980548020_78e813835a_m.jpg" alt="SOG Seal Pup Elite and a nylon sheath" style="float:right;" /></a> Initially I bought the knife with the Kydex sheath because it is quite compact, lightweight and has a neat little feature - a grove that reveals a section of the blade which allows you to cut rope without taking the knife out of its sheath. But after trying different ways to carry the knife (including designing and sewing my own custom thigh attachment system) I realized that the nylon sheath was just better suited for my situation. First of all, it has an additional compartment which I ended up using to store my Leatherman Charge multitool. But more importantly, it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE">MOLLE</a> attachment on the back, which opens up carrying possibilities galore. Also, I was able to attach a small loop of webbing to the side of the sheath for the firesteel.</p><br/><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sudarkoff/2523471368/" title="Chopping down a tree"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2523471368_8d4fc93837_m.jpg" alt="Chopping down a tree" style="float:left;margin-right:1em;" /></a> I used the knife quite extensively at a week-long <a href="/edge.html" title="The Edge">survival camp</a> and I must say I am very happy with its performance. The blade is equally good for chopping down small trees, making a throwing stick, carving a pair of chopsticks or a replica of the knife itself. About the only issue that I had with this knife was the spine rasp - I would prefer if the knife did not have it as it hurts a little when I press against it with my thumbs while carving. But it's a personal preference and I wouldn't hold it against this knife.</p><br/><p>All in all, I am very happy with my SOG and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a dependable fixed-blade knife. Would I recommend it as a survival knife? Well, it's a highly debated question. Some say the blade should be around 4 inches long. Others rightfully note that there's nothing a small blade can do that a big blade cannot. Yet others seek knives with hollow handles to put a small stash of goodies inside (my opinion of those knives is not very favorable). But in the end, it all comes down to personal preference - choose the blade you'll be comfortable carrying with you at all times. For me, this is SOG SEAL Pup Elite!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I bought a SOG Seal Pup with kydex sheath and modified it by cutting out a portion of the sheath so it can be used to cut cord or string without taking it out of the sheath.<br/>Then I added some velcro and a rapalla sharpener (which I cut down to a smaller size) to cover the cut out portion when not cutting cord or rope. The velcro holds a rod of steel striker on the sheath's backside and I put applied some shiny aluminum tape that would be great for signaling. And of course there's 3 metres of paracord that can be used for a lanyard, belt, shelter, etc. Retrofitting (hacking) it was fun, and I'm pleased with the results.<br/>It's a small blade, but I like to travel light. The SOG Seal Pup is comfortable and I feel safe handling it in every task. Finally, the blade lends itself to choking up for finer carving.<br/>I've abused it in the month I've owned it while hacking, batoning, sawing through metal and plastic (the serrations are great), carving the inside of quinzee, and it's performed well.<br/>I would recommend this knife to any outdoor enthusiast. It's light, comfortable, strong and is a safe option for all ages.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I have been looking a bunch of survival knives for a while now and finally decided this is the one I want. The only question I have before I get it is if I should get the serrated or non serrated blade. I am going to be using at the river a lot. Also, I will be using it for fishing, diving, and camping. Any suggestions????</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Mike, I personally prefer a straight edge because: (1) serrated blade is not easy to sharpen when outdoors (leave alone in a survival situation), (2) serration gets in the way when carving, (3) there's very little chance you'll need to skin a large animal with a tough hide.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Climbing 5.10c</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/24/climbing-510c.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went climbing today for the fourth time in my life - good stuff! I was working on my technique, so I was mostly climbing easy 5.7's. However, when I say "technique", I mean whatever I think is the right way of doing it. My hands still hurt after each climb and that is a sure sign that my "technique" is nowhere near where it should be.</p><br/><p>I also tried climbing a very short 5.10c a couple of times and that is where I got some very interesting results. What's interesting is that the difficulty of this route meant that I couldn't just muscle through it. There were no good handholds, and I had to use my legs for climbing. And then the tiny crimps were so far apart that I often had to bend my body in very odd ways and cautiously move from one position to another while keeping balance - thanks to my yoga classes I was able to handle it pretty well. In the end I failed to reach the top, but my hands were actually very well rested after the fifteen minutes of trying painstakingly and failing to attack the crux. I think it was a great technique exercise and I'll do it again next time.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not the first one to think of this obviously (Matrix movie was partly about that), but how about powering our electronic toys with the energy produced by our own bodies? It'll burn additional calories of course, but maybe we'll even solve the obesity problem along the way. Just don't talk on your phone for too long or you'll starve. Running out of juice will take on a whole new meaning. With all the miniaturization and the onset of the embeddable devices, surely some research should have been done in this area already.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">This is a good example of the bad grouping of page elements. Neither of the text blocks clearly "claims" the illustration. Vertical whitespace below the upper text block suggest that the illustration belongs to the block below it. But the header of the second text block separates it from the picture. It would have been much better to place the header above the image and the rest of the text below it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What motivates people to whine about deficiencies and flaws in products they never held in their hands and probably can't afford either?</p><br/><p>Take the Apple's new MacBook Air for example. What do the omega geeks think will be the reason of its demise? Let's enumerate: (1) it has no FireWire port, (2) it has no DVD drive, (3) battery is not user-replaceable, (4) no ethernet port, (5) no ExpressCard slot and, my favorite, (6) it's too thin! The conclusion: "it looks good but isn't for the power user." Power user, I gather, is the one with the most power bricks in his backpack. So the geeks have spoken: MacBook Air is a failure because the random Joe Shmoe couldn't afford it and therefore had to come up with all those lame excuses to use in a conversation with his fellow losers. Allrighty then!</p><br/><p>Now let's see what a person from the <strong>intended</strong> audience would think about all those deficiencies: (1) what's FireWire?, (2) I can watch, rip and burn DVD's on any of my other Macs, (3) never replaced a battery in my laptop and even if I ever need to, I'll ask that genius at the Apple store to do it for me, (4) with integrated 802.11n who needs ethernet?, (5) what's ExpressCard?, (6) when my colleagues see me enter the conference room with only a manila envelope in my hand and produce a stunning looking laptop from it they'll die of envy!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>There is no Bug</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/12/27/there-is-no-bug.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Angry rant alert!]</p><br/><p>Author of the blog &quot;Hyper Agile Thinking&quot; (oy vey!) in his article <a href="http://damonpoole.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/there-is-no-bug-it-is-not-the-bug-that-bends-it-is-only-yourself/">&quot;There is no Bug. It is not the Bug that Bends, it is Only Yourself&quot;</a> argues that:</p><br/><blockquote><p>Only when you realize that “there is no bug”, that the problem lies<br/>within, can you change your behavior (process) such that no bug is<br/>reported on the software that you deliver. I’m not saying that real<br/>software with zero bugs is an attainable goal, only that you consider a<br/>change of perspective in order to bend the spoon a bit.</p><br/><p>...The problems lie within. Only when we acknowledge this and accept it can we hope to affect real change. Agile development is an excellent platform for seamlessly incorporating the required introspection and continual improvement.</p></blockquote><br/><p>Oh, there's no bug, you bet! But behind all those big words you are missing another important problem - there is no program and there is no process either. It is <strong>all</strong> an illusion (if you follow the original logic of &quot;there's no spoon&quot;)! So, while I wholeheartedly agree that it is more accurate to treat bugs like something internal (and really, let's call them defects already?), it doesn't really change anything. Because bugs only &quot;appear&quot; when internal reality collides with external and there is nothing you can do about it. Agile or not, you still have to go outside and test your theories on the harsh real world. You know, by actually giving your shit to people and hoping nothing explodes.</p><br/><p>And while I am at it, don't you think that &quot;agile methodology&quot; is an oxymoron?!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Of course there is a bug! Using the framework of the Matrix is just a fun way to look at things from a different perspective. My point is that Agile provides a better platform for preventing defects and removing the root causes of those defects.<br/>I'm not sure why "Agile methodology" is an oxymoron unless you are saying that Agile is somehow the opposite of methodology. There's always a methodology, even if it isn't written down or expressed. The simplest methodology would be: get idea, decide it is worth doing, think a bit about how to do it, write some code, test it, repeat from "think a bit" until done, deliver. There's always a methodology, it is a question of degree.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Damon, whereas you obviously believe that it is possible to have some agile methodology that is going to save us all, in my opinion, being truly agile means thinking on the spot and not relying on any predetermined or spontaneously formed procedures. In other words, being agile means creating a new methodology every time ad hoc. Something like that.<br/>But what truly pisses me off about Agile fad, is that it's all merely common sense turned into a religion. First it professes flexibility and then goes out of its way to set certain rules in stone and expects people to follow them to a tee. As if one could not be agile without "pair programming" or something.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>George, actually I don't believe that there are any silver bullets out there. However, I do believe that there are always new ideas being introduced that increase our productivity. After all, that's pretty much the whole idea of software in the first place or we'd be out of jobs.<br/>I have no problem with spontaneity. But consider that there is an overarching pattern to traditional development made up of all of those  individual actions. It is that overarching pattern which I believe has problems, not necessarily the individual actions.<br/>My initial impression of Agile was: small teams pair programming in an open area and shuffling 3x5 cards around, guided by overzealous religious fanatics. It is unfortunate that this is a common initial  impression. However, IMHO, there really is something significantly new, different, and worthwhile lurking in there and it doesn't require small teams, pair programming, working in an open area, 3x5 cards, or fanaticism.<br/>Thanks for spending the time to comment on my recent post. I hope that you will read some more and that you'll find a different perspective on Agile than what it sounds like you've experienced so far.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I get a strong feeling the "agile" fad stems from a lot of upset business owners, ivory tower trade writers, and project managers that have amassed enough money to spend free time instructing others on the path to some harmonious efficiency that doesn't exist. It feels like a religious, transforming answer to definable, concrete issues every organization faces. "Why can't I make my software faster, cheaper, and better than the competition using less people?"<br/>Just like in our own lives, some folks rely on religion to address real issues. And just like in our own lives, the zealous ones can be REALLY friggin annoying.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

The last run was the first time when I used Forerunner 305 GPS watch and heart-rate monitor that my wife bought me for x-mass. The software that came with the device allows you to structure, schedule and upload workouts to Forerunner in advance. Then you just tell it to run today's workout and follow the instructions on the screen. Chest strap was quite comfortable - something I was worried about. Screen has just the right amount of information and is quite easy to read. All in all, I am very satisfied with this device! Oh, and the workout was perfect! The temperature was very nice - 50&deg;F and I did a perfect 5 mile endurance run at about 80% of estimated Max HR.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

I wonder why there is no similar thing for address books (webaddr)? Or have I missed it? Imagine, if you could subscribe to your address book on some social networking website and never have to worry about phone numbers and email addresses being obsolete as long as your contacts keep their profiles current (and now they will have an incentive). Imagine, if you could update your own contact information in one place (perhaps, your local address book) and have it pushed to all your contacts automatically and unobtrusively. We already have all the bits and pieces in place, so the only task left is to repackage and popularize it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last couple of months I've been slowly gaining weight and am now about 10 pounds heavier than I was just a short two months ago. Considering that I successfully avoided turkey coma this year and still have New Year's culinary temptations to navigate through, that is a lot of gain and a bit scary!</p><br/><p>So I want to step my running up a notch and build my weekly mileage up to at least 30 miles. Since my current weekly mileage is only about 10 miles on average and I cannot increase it by more than 10% per week, it is going to take me about 16 weeks (or four months) to reach my goal. In order to not loose the track and to keep it interesting I will be publishing my weekly mileage reports starting Mondays.</p><br/><p>Feel free to ridicule me publicly if I start falling behind.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bluetooth stereo headphones in Leopard</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/10/29/bluetooth-stereo-headphones-in-leopard.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, one of the nice features in Leopard is the support for Bluetooth stereo headphones (<span class="jive-subject">A2DP).<br/>As much as I love the simplicity and reliability of the basic iPod ear<br/>bugs, you just can't beat the feeling of freedom that wireless<br/>headphones give you!<br /><br/><br /><br/>I am using Motorola HT820 headphones. They are not the most comfortable<br/>headphones (I have a truckload of headphones of all shapes and price<br/>points in my possession and I find iPod ear buds to be most<br/>comfortable for prolonged usage), but the sound quality is quite acceptable for anything<br/>from talking on the phone to listening to music. Play/Pause, Skip, Rewind and Volume buttons are also supported.<br /></span></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Build numbers</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/9/17/build-numbers.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/">Wincent Colaiuta</a> in his blog post &quot;<a href="http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/build_numbers_i.php">Build numbers in a Git-based development cycle</a>&quot; is trying to come up with the build numbering scheme. His requirements are that the build number (1) uniquely identifies&nbsp; the revision of the source code used in the build and (2) provides a clear distinction between earlier and later builds (i.e. is sequential). Git is a distributed system and as such instead of a sequential revision number it uses sha1 to uniquely identify individual commits. The problem is, sha1 is quite long (even its abbreviated form is seven characters) and absolutely non-sequential.</p><br/><p>I myself just <a href="/2007/09/bye-bye-svn-hel.html">converted all my repositories to git</a>. But my build numbering scheme accommodates new environment just fine, so I wanted to share. First of all, why do you want the build number to be sequential? So that <em>your users</em> could tell which build they have installed on their system and whether or not it is the latest one. Second, why do you want the build number to uniquely identify the sources? So that <em>you</em> (the developer) could pinpoint the sources that were used to make the build (in order to find the change that introduces the bug, for example).</p><br/><p>This divides the problem into two distinct parts and I decided to address them separately. That is, my build number has two components: a sequential number for the user and a unique source code identifier for myself. The former is just a number automatically incremented by the build infrastructure while the latter is the abbreviated sha1 of the latest commit in the repository used by the infrastructure to produce the build. Theoretically, I can have two builds made from the same revision, but in reality my build infrastructure is smart enough to avoid doing unnecessary work. That means, that although the full build number might look quite intimidating (e.g.: 4ef.7e93fcd) the first part of the number is always sufficient to uniquely identify the build. And in fact, the second part is almost never directly communicated to the user.</p><br/><p>Additionally, I never number my developer's builds (builds created from my working tree). It is not only unnecessary, but actually quite undesirable. The reason? It would be a bad idea to distribute a build made from uncommitted changes and I want to make sure that the developer's builds are easily recognizable as such (e.g.: 0.0000000). All this makes it very easy to implement a script that automatically increments the sequential part of the build number and stick the abbreviated sha1 to it to form the complete build number.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>CD turned 25</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/8/21/cd-turned-25.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago CD turned 25. It's hard to believe that it was around for that long! I bought my first audio CD in early 90s -- good ten years after the media debut on August 17, 1982. It was &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; by The Doors. I couldn't listen to it for a good couple of months because I didn't have a player. Then I got a CD ROM drive for my PC. The drive was insanely expensive and had a feel of something that came from outer space.</p><br/><p>Fast forward fifteen years -- I ripped everything I had to my hard drive and I listen to it on the iPod. I don't buy music on CDs anymore either. And finally six months ago, when I was moving from Los Angeles to San Francisco I gave a few hundred of my audio CDs -- everything I owned -- to a friend of mine. So, RIP CD. It was the glorious 25 years and we will remember you kindly!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

A whole bunch of folks will upgrade either by purchasing a new PC with Vista pre-installed or worse yet by buying the ridiculously overpriced upgrade and installing it on their outdated hardware. And the stuff will break: microphones will stop working, printers will stop printing, apps will start crashing, annoying dialog boxes will start popping up everywhere, etc... and suddenly the prospect of switching to a completely different OS all their geekier friends can't stop raving about will become less scary! What do you think?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I've seen Compiz. It looks pretty, but I don't think that "pretty" is what will push Linux over the edge. And it's not about the availability of apps either. I spent an hour trying to make Compiz work on my box. And you need a compiler in order to install many if not most apps. When that is fixed, we'll finally have "a year of linux". Of course, that said, I prefer it to Windows even today.<br/>I turned off html support in comments intentionally (I think). TypeKey thing is a bug, though.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>OS stability over time</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/6/20/os-stability-over-time.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I noticed an interesting phenomenon a couple of days ago. We all know that Windows is susceptible to rot. Things tend to disintegrate over time -- everything feels slower and buggier. That's why the accepted wisdom is to reinstall Windows from time to time. The other day a friend called from Vancouver -- she was having a problem with her microphone. It was working just fine a few days ago but suddenly stopped and there was nothing we could do to revive it. It was a fairly fresh install of Vista which came pre-installed with her new Dell laptop, so it appears that Vista rots even faster.</p><br/><p>It is not so with Linux, though! Linux seems to be getting more and more stable the longer you use it (which at least seems natural). I installed Ubuntu Feisty a couple of months ago on my workstation at work and had been having weird audio problems ever since -- mp3's sounded as if 90 per cent of the frequencies were redirected to /dev/null. I attempted to repair the problem but gave up after a short while due to the lack of experience in this kind of thing (I am a Mac user, our people don't get much practice debugging OS problems). But I kept trying to play mp3's for the next couple of weeks on days when I didn't have my iPod on me and one day, after downloading a routine update, it just worked. Awesome!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>FileVault is not good</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/6/11/filevault-is-not-good.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're thinking about enabling FileVault feature of the Mac OS X to secure the data on your laptop - don't. Instead, create an encrypted disk image and store your important files there. I had been using FileVault for over a year and my experience was rapidly deteriorating lately. Even though FileVault never caused any disasters or a loss of my data, I decided to turn it off a couple of weeks ago and my life is better already! My good old G4 PowerBook is significantly more responsive, it wakes up instantly and reliably (no more looking at the spinning rainbow of death), certain apps no longer "forget" that they are default providers of their services, etc. So, use encrypted disk image to store your important files, don't use FileVault. (And backup your data regularly, but more about this later.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Google Maps for cyclists needed</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/5/15/google-maps-for-cyclists-needed.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How cool would it be if Google Maps were able to produce driving directions suitable for cyclists! It would use only safe streets, streets with bike lanes or bike trails, when possible. The directions would also include elevation information, so that cyclists could avoid hard hills, etc. This would be a fantastic tool and would most definitely encourage more people to choose bikes over cars for their daily commute.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>No blogging</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/5/7/no-blogging.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been quiet for the last couple of months. There are couple of reasons for that. First, about seven weeks ago I accepted a position of a Member of Technical Staff with VMware and moved back to Silicon Valley -- these past couple of months were quite busy. Second, I cannot find a good unobtrusive and reliable way to post to my blog. For short blurbs, I want to be able to do it from anywhere, but using my cellphone is too inconvenient (I abandoned my PDA a few years ago). I could use Google Docs, but (1) it doesn't work with Safari and (2) I wasn't able to make it post to my MovableType-based blog. I also want to be able to "reply" to other people's blog posts on my own blog, but trackbacks seem to have disappeared from all but a few blogs. Third, I had been working on a few longer articles and I realized that (1) I don't want to mix meaningless musings with longer better thought out pieces on the same blog and (2) I don't know how to tell if the article is finished, so I keep revising it over and over and over.</p><br/><p>Any words of advice for me? :)</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

Quite frankly, I can't imagine anyone doing it for any reasonable length of time. I could probably write a couple of scripts that would update my location based on where my bluetooth-enabled phone is registering at the moment, but that would be boring. Plus, the privacy-conscious part of my brain would object! :)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><br/><p><a href="http://www.whereco.com/wp/?p=12">Is Software Becoming a Commodity Business?</a></p><br/><p>Has software development become a commodity business? If John, your mid-level server-side java programmer leaves the company, can you just swap in Jane, another developer with 5 yrs java experience?</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>As I said before, software is a lot like medicine. Some doctors treat the ordinary cold, others specialize in brain surgery. True, ever since antibiotics were discovered, treating many illnesses must have become a pretty mundane business (I have no idea, of course, just guessing). It might appear that all doctors do these days is prescribe either painkillers or antibiotics. But does it mean that medicine is a commodity business? If only!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Pure means impractical?</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/2/2/pure-means-impractical.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, a friend of mine <a href="http://notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/31150.html">complained</a> about Smalltalk being responsible for his increased rent. I responded that to me Smalltalk always was a little bit like Latin and that although learning Latin helps in understanding the structure of <em>other</em> western languages, nobody expects you to actually <em>speak</em> Latin. (I know it doesn't make much sense here, so please go read his <a href="http://notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/31150.html">post</a>.) This lead me to further thinking about things that are sound in theory but not very useful in practice. There seems to be some connection between "pure" and "impractical", don't you think?</p><br/><p>In one of my previous posts I <a href="/2007/01/completeness_vs_consistency.html">argued</a> that software systems are essentially incomplete. I thought it was an interesting argument against obsessing about completeness. But of course in reality software systems are far from formal (pure). Unlike calculus, software systems are not necessarily constrained by any formal set of rules of inference (heuristic and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">evolutionary algorithms</a> come to mind). Same is true about programming languages. In fact, maybe this "impurity" is precisely why programming languages like C++ are so useful?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Completeness vs. consistency</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/1/4/completeness-vs-consistency.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early days of my programming career I was obsessed with completeness of the API's I was constructing. Of course, over the years I learned better, than to waste my time. But I still couldn't construct a clear cut argument against complete API's. Aside from the time constraint issues, "complete" certainly sounds better, than "incomplete". That is before I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godels-Proof-Ernest-Nagel/dp/0814758169" title="G&ouml;del's Proof">Gödel's Proof</a>. The fog has cleared (but my math is still rusty at best, so I could be blowing smoke, for all I know). Clearly (please do correct me if I am wrong), any given software system is a formal axiomatic system and as such, it is essentially incomplete. So there we go, from now on I don't feel guilty concentrating my efforts on consistency instead of completeness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Black and white</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/12/15/black-and-white.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just realized that the majority of people are raging commies and do not even realize it! Every time you hear that something will be good for the community, you hear a commie talking. And it is not necessarily a bad thing. Just like democrats and republicans do not have to be in the opposite camps (they are actually not, they are the same bunch of power and money hungry morons, but that's a different topic altogether).</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the world is not black and white!? Perhaps we need a bit of communism in certain things, a bit of liberalism in other things and a lot of conservatism in most other things? The question is always how far to take any particular idea. I like to think of myself as a libertarian, but I laugh at those crazy idealists that think they can do away without any government. Market forces, they say, will sort things out. And I am sure they will - we'll end up having a government. Not necessarily any better one than we have now. So how about we stop dividing ourselves into Democrats and Republicans, whites and blacks, Ruby on Rails-lovers and those enamored with Python?</p><br/><p>I expect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogons" title="Vogons">Vogons</a> to arrive any minute now.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://macheist.com/">MacHeist</a> is ending this week and so far it generated over $80K for charity and it looks like they will be able to meet their goal of $100K. But it also generated <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/MacHeist">quite a stir</a> in the independent Mac developer community. Not surprisingly, developers are afraid that this campaign that targets cheapsters will hurt the perceived value of the Mac software.</p><br/><p>Guys, calm down! You attribute way to much power to those desperate blokes. It would have been quite spectacular if they did posses the power to influence the market in such titanic proportions, but they don't. They are just trying to come up with an interesting marketing gimmick (something that is rarely successful more than once). And they chose to target cheapsters because it is easy - not the strategy I would choose for my marketing campaign, but is a valid strategy nonetheless. Could it hurt the future sales of those involved? Absolutely it could. (It could also help the sales. It depends on so many things...) But there's absolutely no danger to those not participating in this campaign. You see, just because Walmart is selling jeans <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=930424">on the cheap</a> doesn't mean that <a href="http://www.7forallmankind.com/">7 For All Mankind</a> has no chance at selling their's at a <a href="http://www.7forallmankind.com/Flynt_In_Manhattan/pd/np/3/p/1020.html">much higher price</a>. Don't target the cheapsters and you'll be fine as far as the perceived value of your product goes.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>TextMate to go Leopard-only</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/11/19/textmate-to-go-leopard-only.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blogosphere is abuzz over Allan Odgaard's <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/11/09/20-will-require-leopard/">announcement</a> that most likely TextMate 2.0 will be Leopard-only. <a href="http://technorati.com/search/macromates.com%2Fblog%2Farchives%2F2006%2F11%2F09%2F20-will-require-leopard%2F">Everyone</a> and their monkey has an opinion. I promise mine will be short and irrelevant.</p><br/><p>Allan says that 90% of his users are early adopters. He says that the upgrade is free so he will not be losing any money by abandoning the remaining 10%. Also, by going Leopard-only he will be able to simplify the code, make it more robust by using garbage collection and whatnot, and overall make it worthwhile for those that do upgrade.</p><br/><p>As a software developer I can totally understand his move. It is no fun to  support legacy crap -- the shiny new things that Leopard offers are not only tastier to chew on, they also make our code prettier (and prettier means better in all practical terms). Every single argument is logically sound and makes me nod in agreement. Too bad the situation has nothing to do with logic.</p><br/><p>The people using your software have rights (even if they didn't pay for the software). Of course, it is the kind of right that they cannot defend in court. But users believe in those rights and that is all that matters. It is not even about fairness -- it's about feelings and feelings will be hurt. Users will retaliate and you better be damn sure your brand is capable of sustaining the punch.</p><br/><p>That said, I do believe that now is the best time to piss off a few users in favor of the long-term benefits. Come on, it's 2.0 we are talking about, we all know that it takes three major releases for any software to mature. Even Allan tells us that his users are early adopters. It means that he is yet to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Geoffrey-Moore/dp/0060517123">cross the chasm</a> of obscurity. And why not take the advantage of the situation and shed some weight in preparation for the leap?</p><br/><p>So, does Allan have the right to abandon 10% of his users? Hell yeah! Do users have the right to complain? Hell yeah! Is it going to work out just fine? We shall live and see.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My butt hurts...</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/8/25/my-butt-hurts.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little did I know when I was riding a 10-mile test drive on my new road bike yesterday that my butt will be hurting like a bitch afterwards. My legs were fine, my cardiovascular system didn't even blink, but my butt was absolutely unprepared for the experience! Today I had my rear end suspended in the air for the whole ride to work. And it's a good thing I live only a mile from the office! No doubt I will be buying one of those gel-padded pants shortly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is a program that assists in the recovery and prevention of Repetitive Strain Injury. Among its less visible features is the page that lists all sorts of statistics.

      <title>Dvorak, 56WPM</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/8/16/dvorak-56wpm.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been six months since I updated you on my Dvorak typing speed. Presently it is 56 words per minute with the average error rate of 6.4 per cent.</p><br/><p>It is slightly slower than 60WPM I had before switching from QWERTY to Dvorak. And the error rate should be well below 5% to consider my typing accurate. So, some might say that it is a failed experiment--not only do I not type 40% faster than I did before the switch, but it is actually even slightly slower and less accurate. Well, to me it's a definite success! First, I didn't get enough practice as I am not a typist and my job functions do not include typing (other than the short cryptic blurbs consisting primarily of all kinds of braces, underscores, ampersands, semicolons, slashes, etc.). But most importantly, my wrists experienced no pain in the last half year, which I think is not a coincedence and a good enough reason to stick with Dvorak.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

I would like to believe that it's just a glitch and they will fix it soon to avoid pissing off more people. Luckily, their online app allows you to print out the whole thing (albeit with poorer quality). And of course printing to pdf is a snap on a Mac.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Show by Ze</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/7/14/the-show-by-ze.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My favorite video podcast is "the show" by <a href="http://zefrank.com/" title="the show">Ze Frank</a>. Here's the snippet from my transcript of one of his latest episodes:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>I run out of ideas every day. Each day I live in mortal fear that I used up the last idea that will ever come to me. If you don't want to run out of ideas, the best thing to do is not to execute them. You can tell yourself that you don't have the time or resources to do them right. Then they stay around in your head like brain crack. No matter how bad things get at least you have all those good ideas that you'll get to later. Some people get addicted to that brain crack and the longer they wait the more they convince themselves of how perfectly that idea should be executed. And they imagine it on a beautiful platter with glitter and rose petals and everyone's clapping <em>for them</em>. But the..., but the..., but the bummer is most ideas kinda suck when you do 'em. And no matter how much you plan you'll still have to do something for the first time. And you almost guaranteed the first time you do something it will blow. But somebody who does something bad three times still has three times the experience of that other person who is still dreaming of all the applause. When I get an idea I try to get it out in the world as fast as possible. Cause I certainly don't want to be addicted to brain crack.</p><br/></blockquote><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Running partner</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/7/11/running-partner.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I realized something yesterday - I need a running partner or a group. So I started looking for a running club in and around of Calabasas. Here's how I figured I need a running buddy.</p><br/><p>Yesterday night I headed out for a run. Finally, after a couple of weeks of hot weather and all my runs taking place on a dreaded treadmill, I was running outside and was enjoying it immensely. I was running a slow but steady pace of 9:00"/mi and it felt really great. And as I was approaching the last half-mile stretch a young fella wearing a hydration backpack (which pretty much means this was his long run) zoomed by so fast that I instantly felt like I was walking compared to him. Naturally, my male ego was hurt and I started catching up with the guy. When I evened out the pace and glanced at my Forerunner it was showing a whooping 7:30"/mi pace! And the most amazing part - it didn't feel all that hard, <em>it felt awesome</em>! So, first, I need to re-examine my training regimen. And second, I need a running partner that will push me a bit.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="coComment: Collect, organize and share your internet conversations" href="http://cocomment.com/">coComment</a> is great, but I was thinking (a couple of months ago, actually) -- why not just implement a simple ping thingy for comments? You post a comment on somebody's weblog/website, you leave a url (perhaps it's your <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> URL) and the weblog pings you back every time a new comment is posted in that thread. Simple, decentralized and doesn't require any new code to be written other than to put a few existing things together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Design</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/6/5/design.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is funny, no doubt:</p><br/><blockquote>Design consists of creating things for clients who may not know what they want, until they see what you've done, then they know exactly what they want, but it's not what you did.  [<a title="design matters: Skeet shooting in the dark" href="http://bscodesignmatters.blogspot.com/2006/05/skeet-shooting-in-dark.html">link</a>]<br/></blockquote><br/><p>But sure our clients know what they want, we just can't transfer that knowledge from their heads to ours in a form that is immediately consumable. There's only that much you can convey with words, boxes and arrows. The knowledge in its purest form just has to evolve over time. That's why constant communication is important &mdash; it is a transport for knowledge. (And that's why outsourced teams are at an inherent disadvantage.)</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Running in 100 degrees Fahrenheit</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/6/5/running-in-100-degrees-fahrenheit.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Last Saturday's long run didn't go very well. By Siberian guy's standards the weather was absolutely nasty — 100° Fahrenheit and 100% humid. I only managed to cover 3.7 miles with a couple of hours of layover in the air-conditioned office in the middle of the workout and at the embarrassingly pedestrian 11:00/mi. At the corner where I could have taken a longer route home, the "Steam Machine" by Daft Punk started playing in my earbuds; I figured that it was as good a sign as I could get without involving ER and took a shortcut instead. Something tells me that I will be running in the mornings from now on.<br/></p><p><br/>By the way, I noticed that more than 50% of my "power" running playlist consists of the tunes by The Crystal Method — I wonder if the guys are endurance sportsmen themselves. With track names like Bound Too Long, Ready For Action, Tough Guy, Trip Like I Do, Murder, Name Of The Game, Comin' Back and Starting Over they just have to be.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/><img src="http://sudarkoff.typepad.com/images/20060529-calabasas-route.png" height="702" width="398" border="0" alt="Running route map" title="Running route map" /><br/></p><p><br/>Distance: <strong>7.79 mi</strong><br/><br />Time: <strong>01:10:04</strong><br/><br />Speed: <strong>6.67 mph</strong><br/></p><p><br/>I wasn't planning on running this far today. But I never ran this route before and it goes through the park with no trails visible on any map, so my estimate was off by about a mile. And on top of that I made a wrong turn (notice that odd appendix in the upper left corner of the map) and ended up in a residential area with lots of culs-de-sac and pretty steep hills. I had to stop and call my wife to help me find my way out. As a result I ran eight miles instead of four. But since I just started running after almost two months of rest (read "procrastination"), I wasn't pushing myself too hard, so eight miles were not a problem.<br/></p><p><br/>I saw a lot of wildlife in the park - a couple of deers, lots of hares and squirrels. But running there wasn't as fun as I hoped it would be. The grass is very high and stinging this time of the year. Next time I run there, I will put on pants instead of shorts.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2006/2/13/paper-vs-digits.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my world paper will never beat the digits. Paper is accessible and familiar when you need to capture the ideas (especialy on the go), but paper is also inaccessible and bulky when you try to store and retrieve the information later. That everyone has been falling in love with paper lately is nothing more to me than a sign that a much better digital experience is about to emerge. And me, I'm not waiting, I am trying hard to make this happen. More about this later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Google Talk</title>
      <link>/blog/2006/1/20/google-talk.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I kinda always wanted to get rid of a bunch of extraneous IM accounts I have hanging around in my IM client (Adium, by the way, is the best multiprotocol IM client for Mac in my opinion) and leave just a couple of them I use the most. The problem with this, of course, is that I have contacts in all networks and I would hate to lose them. For a while I tried to convince my ICQ and MSN people to switch to other networks. As ICQ's old protocol, for example, is badly supported, doesn't handle Unicode very well and overall is not the most pleasant to deal with -- whose idea was to use strings of arbitrary numbers for screen names!? But you know how it goes -- if there's no obvious reason (other than me whining), then there's no reason.</p><br/><p>But now that I can't use anything but Google Talk at work (for various reasons), I finally made the leap. So, if you want to talk to me, please consider downloading and installing Google Talk or configuring your favorite multinetwork IM client accordingly. In GTalk world your screen name is your GMail email address, so you'll know how to find me. Otherwise leave a comment in this entry and I'll get back to you.</p><br/><p>Hopefully, Google will implement the server-to-server part of the Jabber protocol soon and so we'll be able to use gateways to connect to other networks as I still would love to be able to talk to Yahoo! IM people, but until then I urge you to try Google Talk. And see you on GTalk!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2005/12/29/meta-reminders.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>My wife surprised me with some productivity innovation today. A few minutes ago an alarm on her cell phone went off. When I asked her what it was about she told me that it's a meta-reminder. A couple of hours ago she remembered that she had to remember to do something in the evening and so she set up an alarm without actually remembering what exactly she was supposed to do. Of course, the problem is, she still could not remember it when the alarm went off, so it's really not a very effective innovation, but still it's quite funny.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Indenting code in Python</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/12/29/indenting-code-in-python.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I'm playing with Python and I must say I'm impressed by its simplicity and power! But I have one (theoretical) problem with its indentation-defines-scope approach. What if (and I stress "if" here) all my indentation goes south, how am I supposed to know what part of the code belongs to which scope? As I said, it is strictly theoretical, as I use source control to store even my perl one-liners. But still, whitespace being semantically that significant is quite frightening to me.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>David Weinberger <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/does_free_software_chill_innov.html">writes</a>:<br/></p><blockquote><br/><a href="http://www.salas.com/weblogs/archives/001008.php">Pito Salas</a> wonders if the market's expectation that broad classes of software just ought to be free is preventing some very cool apps from being developed.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>First of all, I disagree that there is such expectation.<br/></p><p><br/>Better alternatives always have and always will cost something (money, time, effort, ease of use, compatibility, peace of mind, whatever). People choose free apps (1) because they have extra time/energy to make and keep the stuff working, (2) because they can't afford that beast trying to solve all problems at once, (3) because they are pissed at bad service/support they paid for when using commercial app, etc. If I, for one, find a certain app to be better than its free alternative (and if it's priced reasonably)—I buy it. Also, "free" <em>is</em> a price. Make your stuff better and you won't have to compete with "free".<br/></p><p><br/>And if there is an expectation that certain types of software ought to be free, then maybe it's a good thing? Maybe those types of software enable something important and that's why we expect it to be free?<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Imagine a Naming Service that maps people's unique identity handles to their phone numbers, mailing addresses, emails and whatnot. How cool would it be to never ever have to notify all five thousand of your closest friends when your phone number changes, or worse yet, when you move to another state! At the post office they would just fetch your current mailing address and route the correspondence accordingly. Same happens when someone is phoning, emailing or instant-messaging you.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Electronic Book</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/12/17/electronic-book.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Thomas Nelson, President and CEO of the "largest Christian publishing company in the world" (I could never really understand what the word "Christian" is supposed to mean in relation to anything but the religion itself) has an <a href="http://www.michaelhyatt.com/workingsmart/2005/12/the_death_of_tr.html">opinion on what the electronic book might look like</a>.<br/></p><p><br/>Personally, I wouldn't buy what he is envisioning, so let me take on his bullets one-by-one:<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It looks similar to a tablet PC slate. No keyboard, no monitor, and it folds in half.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>Why would you want it to fold in half? What for? Folding in half made perfect sense for paper, it makes very little sense for an e-book.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It is the same size and thickness as a hardcover book, say 6" by 9" by 1/2". Unfolded, it is 12" x 9" by 1/4". It feels great in your lap. It can even be bent slightly like a book, so you can curl up on the sofa and read away.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>I want (and expect) it to be pencil-thin or maybe even thinner (if it is flexible)!<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It uses a tablet PC interface with a built-in stylus that feels like a high-end pen. You can use it to make menu selections, enter text (via handwriting recognition), or highlight passages in books.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>Tablet PC interface is not perfect for PC and it makes even less sense for a book. And I want to be able to manage with just my fingers in most cases.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It weighs less than a 256-page hardcover book (about one pound). It therefore dramatically changes the shape and heft of your computer bag.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>Can't argue with that!<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It has a battery life of 12–18 hours.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>It should have a battery life of a few weeks. Using technology like <a href="http://www.eink.com/">E Ink</a> it would only need power to refresh the page every few seconds or so.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It completely replaces your computer and runs all your favorite applications.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>See my comment for the next bullet.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It has 256 gigabytes of flash drive storage. It has room for tens of thousands of songs, photos, movies—and books. Because it has no moving parts (unlike a hard drive), it is faster and more reliable.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>I don't like the convergence of this kind (if it results in one function inhibiting some other). If my e-book can also play music and/or movies—fine, but if those <em>additional</em> features make it a less perfect e-book reader—the hell with them! Electronic book is for reading and maybe occasional writing.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It is wi-fi enabled (of course).<br/></blockquote><p><br/>No objections.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It includes a software application similar to iTunes for the purchase and download of books. Heck, maybe it's just a modification of iTunes.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>Absolutely! Especially, if the price is adequate.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It has a simple, elegant book reading application, similar to Microsoft’s Reader.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>It <em>is</em> a book reading application in itself.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It has a docking station that allows you to use a keyboard, mouse, external monitor, etc.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>A Bluetooth keyboard would be more than enough for occasional note taking and blog/comment writing.<br/></p><blockquote><br/>It runs an Apple operating system. (Okay, I couldn't resist.)<br/></blockquote><p><br/>I don't care what operating system it runs unless it gives me reasons to hate it.<br/></p><p><br/>P.S. Perhaps, Thomas, you just need a better Tablet PC?<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Simplicity vs Complexity</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/12/10/simplicity-vs-complexity.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>The other day, while a bunch of us were out drinking beer, a friend of mine slipped a phrase about how he didn't agree with the tendency of dumbing things down for all sorts of users (or something to that effect). Because he is a smart fellow, I immediately dismissed the urge to call him stupid :-) and instead put the thought on the back-burner where it has been slowly simmering ever since.<br/></p><p><br/>Just now I remembered that a few weeks back I had a discussion of this very topic with my former co-worker. My own point at that time was very much along the same lines. Specifically, that although, on one hand, I love the fact that I don't have to be constantly peering into the map fearing that I'll miss my turn while driving—we have signs on every turn (or in some cases onboard navigation systems) telling us what to do next, but on the other hand, I am afraid these everyday conveniences take away something important from us. They rid us of that invaluable ordeal of the raw unprocessed life.<br/></p><p><br/>Take penicillin (my favorite metaphor for progress)—humans sure do live longer, but we also have even more illnesses that we cannot cure now. Are we sure that by letting the drug help us fight the illness we haven't robbed our bodies of the chance to prepare itself for the fight against some new quickly mutating virus? Seemingly, by "simplifying" our lives we actually make them more difficult! How do we avoid this downward spiral? How do we make our lives more comfortable but not get dumber?<br/></p><p><br/>I do believe that simplicity is the main tool in this endeavor. Mother nature (and fellow- humans) will continue to throw new challenges at us. We want to make sure that our newly developed ways of dealing with those challenges are simple enough to be easily reproduced. We should learn to depend on our ways more than we depend on our tools. It is pathetic when a grown man, stranded in the bushes, cannot open a can without a can-opener.<br/></p><p><br/>But what is it that I'm really talking about? I know computers, let's talk about computers. Take your average office application—MS Word. How many features does Word have? How many of its features do you personally know and use? Do you use fields or forms? Cross-references? Watermarks? How about AutoSummarize (and why the hell is it spelled like this?), Merge Documents? How many of you even used your own custom styles? Does all this make your writing easier? I don't know about you, but I find myself using TeX more and more often if I need to write a paper. I find TeX to be easier than Word, how about that!? And Word—with all its WISIWIG and whatnot—is supposed to make writing easier!<br/></p><p><br/>Now let's look at your VCR (if you still have one). How many features does it have, how many of them do you use? Does it have VCR Plus+? Most probably it does because "VCR Plus+ is available in all major brands of VCRs," according to TVGuide.com. Do you know what it does? Well, me too. But do you actually use this feature? I don't, and I have very little desire to even try. I'm looking at the remote now and here are some of the buttons I am noticing: C/A skip, M/A skip, SAP, ADD/DLT—what the hell are these for?! Does it make me think harder? I don't think so, I think this unnecessary complexity is exactly why I feel a certain dumbness when I try to program my VCR—a dumbness of whoever designed this uninspiring UI.<br/></p><p><br/>So, what do you think? Simple of complex?<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Speech/voice recognition</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/11/29/speechvoice-recognition.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>A lot of folks are <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/11/15/1406852.html">skeptical about the future of speech</a> as a computer interface and they even try to think of what will <a href="http://www.applematters.com/index.php/section/comments/what_is_the_next_user_interface/">replace the good ol' mouse</a>. And although I agree with them in certain cases (excessive chatter in the workplace being the biggest bummer), I believe they are missing the point here. First of all, it is important to note that natural language-based interface is a broader concept and <a href="/2005/08/nonacoustic_speech_detection.html">doesn't have to involve voicing the commands</a>. Second, your computer system (it could be something as small as your mobile phone) doesn't have to listen to your commands all the time—you push the button and <em>then</em> you speak your command or you receive the call and <em>then</em> you say "busy" or "hello". Your Smart House doesn't have to listen to you all the time in every single corner of your mansion—you push the button on the remote and speak into the tiny microphone imbedded into the remote. Your car doesn't have to listen to you all the time—just push the button on the steering wheel and say "directions". And that's all been done already and it's working.<br/></p><p><br/>On the other hand, how do you know when to listen? You detect some motion towards you, someone calls your name or turns their head in your direction, you hear a pitch and/or amplitude increase in their voice, etc. These are all the "buttons" that other people push to attract our attention before they start speaking to us. Sometimes they fail—I am sure all of you had this experience when someone talks to you and you do not recognize the fact immediately and when you finally do it's too late and you have to ask them: "are you talking to me, could you repeat that please?" So, my point is that pretty soon computers will come to be just a little bit better at reading those cues and speech recognition will become ubiquitous. These things don't have to be complicated to be useful.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A perfect feed reader</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/11/15/a-perfect-feed-reader.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Why email paradigm doesn't work for a feed reader? What will work? (Must I always add "for me"?)<br/></p><p><br/>First of all, there's simply too many articles in my feed reader to read them all. And thus to stay on top of my reading list I need my feed reader to become a tool which would help me decide what to read first and what to skip all together.<br/></p><p><br/>Second, I do not sort my mail in the same way I sort my feeds. With email most of the time it is about action: this email requires immediate reply, here my boss is asking me to write a project plan, that one I'll put away and will follow-up on it later when I have more information, etc. Whereas with feeds everything is about attention: I like this topic and I want to read more on it, that author is funny and I'd like to check out her other blogs, etc.<br/></p><p><br/>For a mail client simple filters work just fine: if this message is related to project A and I need to act upon it sometime later today I'll move it to a folder named 'Project A' and assign an 'Action' tag to it – my mail client can do it semi-automatically with some very simple filters. Feeds require a radically different approach. Labeling articles based simply on their content is not going to work. In my case, for example, I have close to half a thousand feeds that I subscribe to. I do not read all of them (it's impossible!), but I want to stay subscribed and I don't want to miss that rare moment when something interesting/important appears in the feed. Also, I don't want to waste my time on articles that just repeat something I have read about elsewhere and which do not add anything significant to the topic. In the absence of better tools I group and shuffle feeds manually, but I cannot do that on the article level.<br/></p><p><br/>Is it possible? <a href="http://searchfox.com/">SearchFox</a> is just one example of what could be done in this area. (I am not using it for more than just to make sure that there is hope as I'd like it to do much more than it does and I am not sure a web-based client is the right way to go.) But I don't see other feed readers integrating attention management into them and I don't hear anyone talking about it anymore. Is it because something is cooking? I really hope so!<br/></p><p><br/><strong>Update:</strong> There's been some activity in the Attention area lately. You can read more about it on Steve Gillmor's and Michael Vizard's <a href="http://attentiontech.podshow.com/">AttentionTech blog</a>.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What stinks?</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/11/13/what-stinks.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Today was a grocery shopping day. When we came home and started to unload food into the fridge, we discovered that something we had just bought stunk like it was rottening for quite some time already. We were infuriated trying to find what stunk that bad, but to no avail – all obvious "candidates" were thoroughly sniffed at and ruled out. When after a few minutes we were ready to start taking things apart, I remembered that I picked up a piece of semi-soft French cheese at Trader Joe's to try. And so I took a sniff and almost passed out! Good god, it stunk like hell! We started to think about taking it down to a sea-side town, and burying it on the beach. But then, again, we were afraid that it would give the place quite a rap and changed our mind.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Change of hosting, redirect</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/11/9/change-of-hosting-redirect.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I just glanced at my <a href="http://feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> statistics and noticed that my readership shrunk by 75 per cent! "What is going on?!" – I thought to myself, when it occurred to me that I forgot to setup redirects for my older feed URL's when switching the hosting a couple of weeks ago. That's how you learn that people still use those "obsolete" URL's in their feed-readers. That's fine with me, I'll just have to remember about this bit next time I switch hosting (which I hope won't happen again any time soon). Anyway, it all should be working fine now.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Number of open apps</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/11/8/number-of-open-apps.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I noticed that I have about a dozen of different apps running on my PowerBook at any given time. This would never happen to me on Windows. What does it mean, you ask? It means Mac OS uses collections of smaller apps to do the job instead of packing it all into a single package. It means those smaller apps start a lot faster and they are easier to use (and develop). It means the integration is done on the applications level. It means you can mix and match and substitute apps to adopt your very own unique style of getting things done. It means everybody wins – developers get a chance of finding their own niche for doing the same thing a little (or a lot) differently and users get to choose from a variety of similar apps to better satisfy their needs!<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2005/11/i_just_write_th.html">Pandora: "I just write the kind of music I want to hear on my car stereo."</a>:<br/><br />I've been thinking alot lately about the music 'cool' factor. What makes one artist 'legit' and another a 'sellout'; one artist a 'serious' musician, another a 'phony'? Why are people sometimes embarrassed about their music tastes?<br/></blockquote><p>In my iTunes library—in the "Absolute Best" category—I have stuff like Squirrel Nut Zippers, Britney Spears, Saskia Laroo, Björk, Cake, Madonna, Linkin Park, Gwen Stefani, King Crimson, Shania Twain, Cesaria Evora, Tom Waits, FatBoy Slim and god knows what else. How does it make me feel? Pretty freaking great!<br/></p><p>That is not to say I don't know what Tim is talking about—I used to feel the embarrassment myself. But not anymore!<br/></p><blockquote>I sometimes wonder what would happen if all music was published anonymously... Maybe with Pandora we can start a new trend of ignoring artist labels and shining the spotlight back on the music.<br/></blockquote><p>That's pretty much how it is with me and my music. It took me a couple of months before I figured out that the song I like running to so much is the "Name of the Game" by "The Crystal Method". And that's about all I know about that song (and also that it's about 90 BPM, since that happens to be the perfect stride cadence for running).<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about. We need more music lovers like you, george.  I think that this 'cool' thing winds up actually affecting the way musicians write and perform music, because they don't want to suffer Rob Tomas' fate.  When I was gigging in bands there was alot of pressure to be loud and edgy because it was safe.  That inevitably pulled us away from what we really wanted to play.  Musicians are a terribly insecure bunch, for the most part.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Mute/unmute the sound</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/10/28/muteunmute-the-sound.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I absolutely love Mac OS X for that behind the cute facade there's an even more beautiful thing called unix. Combine the power of unix shell with wide adoption of AppleScript and you can achieve pretty much anything. For example, to automatically mute the sound at night, just do the following:<br/></p><p><br/>1. Start the Terminal<br/><br />2. Open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" title="Wikipedia article describing crontab">crontab</a> for editing using the following command:<br/></p><pre>$ crontab -e<br/></pre><p><br/>3. Now copy these two lines into the editor:<br/></p><pre>0 1 * * * osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set volume with output muted'<br/>0 6 * * * osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set volume without output muted'<br/></pre><p><br/>4. Save and quit and you're done. This will mute the sound at 1:00AM and un-mute it at 6:00AM.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>AppleScript, Email Announcer</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/10/27/applescript-email-announcer.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p><br/>Here&#8217;s a little AppleScript I wrote to announce new emails in Mail.app. It pauses the iTunes if it&#8217;s playing, speaks the name of the sender if the message is not marked as junk and then resumes the playback.<br/></p><pre>on perform<em>mail</em>action(info)<br/>-- see if iTunes is playing<br/>set itunes<em>playing to false<br/>tell application "System Events"<br/>if (get name of every process) does not contain "iTunes" then<br/>set itunes</em>playing to false<br/>else<br/>tell application "iTunes"<br/>if player state is playing then set itunes<em>playing to true<br/>end tell<br/>end if<br/>end tell<br/><p>    -- pause iTunes if needed    <br /><br/>if itunes</em>playing is true then tell application "iTunes" to pause</p><br/><p>    tell application "Mail"<br /><br/>set the<em>messages to |SelectedMessages| of info<br /><br/>repeat with a</em>message in the<em>messages<br /><br/>set the</em>sender to extract name from sender of a<em>message<br /><br/>if (junk mail status of a</em>message) is not true then<br /><br/>say "Mail from " &#38; the<em>sender<br /><br/>end if<br /><br/>end repeat<br /><br/>end tell</p><br/><p>    -- resume iTunes if it was playing before<br /><br/>if itunes</em>playing is true then tell application "iTunes" to play<br /><br/>end perform<em>mail</em>action<br /><br/></pre><p><br /><br/>Keep in mind that the script might turn up to be quite chatty depending on the amount of mail that you receive every day. One way of dealing with this is to apply the script only to those emails sent by people in a certain group (Friends, Family, Colleagues and so on).

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>The line 'set the_sender to extract name from sender of a_message' extracts the <em>name</em> of the sender from email header, not their email address. Unfortunately, for this to work correctly the field From: should include the name of the sender. It should look something like this:<br/>From: Jonathan Miller &lt;jrm@xyz.com&gt;<br/>If it doesn't -- that's why you hear "germ".<br/>There’s couple of things you can do about it. First, and I understand that it's not always possible, you can ask Jonathan to configure his email client to always put the name in the From: field. Most probably all it takes to achieve that is to fill in the name field of the account settings. Second, you can try and parse the signature from an email message, but I wouldn't advice taking this route as it is not a simple task. Finally, you can create a LUT (look-up table) and manually populate it with custom names of your regular senders. This is the easiest and most reliable way of solving the problem. Please let me know if you need further help.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Ok this is for Kayla: first copy the code above, then open Apple Script Editor, create a new document, paste the code, [DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING], save it as a script (Give it a name) and place it on ~/Library/Scrpts/Mail Scripts (If Mail Scripts doesn't exist create it) btw "~" means the User name such as "John", now open Mail, then mail preferences, and go to rules, create a new rule put any description you want like "Announce New Mail" then if ANY of the following conditions are met:, FROM, CONTAINS, then type "@" without the quotes, then where it says Perform the following actions: choose RUN APPLESCRIPT, then select the scripts from the folder where you placed it which is ~/Library/Scripts/Mail Scripts and Voilà! Test it with music playing on iTunes of course and ask someone to send you a e-mail message or just message yourself. IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL!!!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br/>The script is great. I just love it. However... I also use Mail to receive RSS articles. Whenever an RSS article arrives, the script pauses iTunes but doesn't restart it. I've added an errorhandler and found that an error is generated (-1728 Can't get &lt;&gt;). Obviously, there is no From: header in an RSS article. This causes the error. But, now I'm at a loss how to solve this.<br/>Is there a way to detect the type of message (RSS or email) so I can distinguish between them, "say" different things and (most importantly) restart iTunes again?<br/>Thanks, Mausy5043</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Refactoring</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a title="24.txt" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103955/categories/stupidHumanProgramming/2005/10/24.html#a202">To Really Improve Your System You Can't Refactor</a><br/><p>I firmly believe in constantly improving my code and I see a difference in quality because of that. Seemingly this would put me firmly in the refactoring camp. But it doesn't. Why? Refactoring says you can't break interfaces. That puts me in an awkward position.</blockquote></p><br/><p>Refactoring is all about improving your code and making sure your tests still pass along the way. There could be no single method that works equaly good for everyone and in every situation, though. I once was refactoring the library and at some point just realized that it's going to take far less time if I just rewrote it. And so I did, and the resulting code was only 20% as big and it was all new code. But I still call it refactoring! Because even though I was writing a new code, I still had the existing code to consult with.</p><br/><p>What's good about the method, though, is that we can automate some of the routine tasks of refactoring.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>PulpFiction and attention management</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/9/24/pulpfiction-and-attention-management.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PulpFiction was awarded an 8 out of 10 rating by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/newsreaders-mac.ars/">Ars Technica</a>. Here's what I think, <a href="http://don.yacktman.org/blog/archives/2005/09/22/pulpfiction-reviewed">Don</a> and <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2005/09/22/pulpfiction_gets_an_810_at_ars.php">Erik</a><sup>*</sup>. As much as I agree with you both on the "I need to manage my news articles" vs. "I need to manage my feeds" point, I think it would help enourmously if you would let your users organize their feeds as well. One of the reasons I still don't use PulpFiction (even though I bought it more than a year ago) is because Smart Folders are just not smart enough for me.</p><br/><p>It would be ideal if I could organize my feeds myself and then let the feedreader organize the articles for me automatically. Like <a href="http://rss.searchfox.com">SearchFox</a> but locally. (In fact, I would love to see SearchFox provide an API for developers to utilize, but that's a separate topic.)</p><br/><p><sup>*</sup> Erik, my apologies for misspelling your name!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Ouch! Erik, sorry for misspelling your name! I used to have a colleague named Eric and it must have put me out...<br/>"Smarter" folders will require a lot more metadata than feeds normaly provide on their own. At the very least, I'd like to be able to organize the feeds—put them in separate folders (that's what I have right now) or better yet—tag them (that's what I'd LOVE to have!). This along will allow me to create better smart folders.<br/>Also, why not expose more of what we <em>do</em> have in the feeds? Like 1) date article posted, 2) date modified, 3) enclosure type, 4) feed type (I know I am getting too excited here, but why not?), 5) geotag fields, 6) other RSS-extensions' fields, etc.<br/>Another way to get more metadata is to derive it from the reader's habits—how much time s/he spends reading any particular article, what's being flagged, what's being deleted, what others find interesting (this will require some sort of web-service, obviously), and so on.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Your "remember me" stuff appears to be broken. You may want to look into that.<br/>"Tags" exist. They're called "labels" and they can - or optionally cannot - actually use a color. You can also turn the color off.<br/>Now, on to the rest:<br/>Date posted and date modified - around 40% of feeds and articles don't post the proper dates and most don't post the proper times. Until that situation changes, there's little a "date posted" flag will find. Furthermore, you can sort (with the column headers) by date posted, which allows you to change your viewing preference from "today" to "the past three days" without changing any settings. Just scroll further to expand (or shrink) your range.<br/>Enclosures were a bit of a rush, and support for them will be expanded. As it stands, "download" is fine if you have any ability to AppleScript the results. Put all enclosures in a folder and use an AppleScript to put the JPEGs somewhere, the .mp3s somewhere else, the .movs somewhere, and so forth.<br/>Geotag? "Other" stuff? This isn't used nearly as often as you'd like to think. About 2% of feeds have geotag fields, and the number has been steadily decreasing. As a software developer, you have to spend time fixing problems and enhancing situations that bring about joy and productivity to the greatest amount of people. 2% or less is, by definition, a low-priority issue.<br/>Send your thoughts in an email to Don and I'm sure he'll have more to say.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Running stride rate</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/9/12/running-stride-rate.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I was running an improvised <a href="/running/entry/80">5K race</a> (finished it in 28:45 minutes) and I noticed that my stride rate was ranging somewhere between 90 and 95 steps for each leg per minute. I thought it is a bit too frequent (i.e. my stride is too short) and I probably waste a lot of energy because of that. But when I came home and researched this a little bit to my great surprise I've discovered that this is exactly what they recommend the cadence should be for the best running economy. Wow! It is nice when something like this comes naturally to you!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A few product ideas</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/8/31/a-few-product-ideas.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>As I was indulging myself in almost an hour of <a href="/running/entry/75">running</a> today, I <a href="/archives/2005/07/26/innovation.html">thought to myself</a>&#8212;"why, oh why there's no&#8230;"&#8212;and then I had three loosely joined thoughts came to my mind at the same time:<br/></p><p><br/>1. First of all, I want a lightweight (so I could run with it) bluetooth-enabled stereo headset (with microphone) that I could program to respond to a few devices at the time. For example, if my phone rings, pause the music that I might be listening to at that time and let me answer the call. Or, if my wearable fitness-oriented GPS announces some information like my current pace or mileage&#8212;lower the volume of the music, let the announcement through.<br/></p><p><br/>2. All (well, many) laptops should have rotating and touch-sensitive screens. I won't buy it <em>instead</em> of a true tablet as the latter should be small and lightweight, but the rotating screen on a regular laptop would prove useful in many situations, even if not touch-sensitive.<br/></p><p><br/>3. The last, but probably the most missed by me right now is the Serial-2-Bluetooth adapter. I won't even elaborate on this idea as all those ancient devices laying around in their own puke of wires and cables speak for themselves.<br/></p><p><br/><strong>Update: </strong>Scratch that last one as I have <a href="http://www.socketcom.com/product/CS0400-479.asp">found</a> what I needed!<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hieroglyphs</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/8/15/hieroglyphs.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>A few of weeks ago a friend of mine mentioned that the Chinese hieroglyphs were a big deal when introduced because they unified a large country by creating a notation that everybody could understand, regardless of what the things it denoted were actually called in any particular language or dialect. I am sure it all made a lot of sense a few centuries ago (especially, taking into account relative unimportance of the written language to most people). Nonetheless, in my guts I knew that this was the bad design choice, I just couldn't put in words what exactly I didn't like about it.<br/></p><p><br/>Yesterday it dawned on me! Yes, they unified the written language&#8212;the fact that two people who couldn't understand each other talking, could communicate in writing was truly a miracle, but still they couldn't <em>talk</em> to each other. And this is ironic, because you still had to learn quite a lot of new stuff&#8212;some five thousand characters (or whatever the actual number is)&#8212;and nowadays they do have the language that everyone speaks&#8212;Mandarin&#8212;but now they stuck with the writing system that is nothing but pain&#8212;pain to learn and pain to use (if you ever saw a Chinese person typing, you know what I am talking about.)<br/></p><p><br/>What does it teach us? Obvious (albeit partial) solutions&#8212;however brilliant they might look at the time&#8212;are not necessarily good solutions in the long run. And more often than not, big complex systems need refactoring to move forward.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Non-acoustic speech detection</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/8/14/non-acoustic-speech-detection.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>A friend of mine <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/joicy/31535.html?thread=236591#t236591">argues (in russian)</a>, that our thoughts are so sporadic and non-linear that it is going to be hard to concentrate on the topic while "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7247">thinking in</a>" (as opposed to "typing in") an article. But I think that even if we're not able to isolate those irrelevant thoughts, they might be very interesting to preserve as some sort of metadata. Imagine how much more useful information we would be able to transmit in an email (if there were still email in ten years) to our distant relatives if we had all those immediate and "irrelevant" distractions recorded!<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I just contacted some russian webmail service to ask why they blocked my IP address, filed the ticket and got the following response:<br/></p><blockquote><br/><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#1053;&#1072;&#1076;&#1077;&#1077;&#1084;&#1089;&#1103;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1057;&#1083;&#1091;&#1078;&#1073;&#1072; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1076;&#1077;&#1088;&#1078;&#1082;&#1080; &#1073;&#1099;&#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1086; &#1080; &#1082;&#1086;&#1084;&#1087;&#1077;&#1090;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;&#1085;&#1086; &#1086;&#1090;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090;&#1080;&#1090; &#1085;&#1072; &#1042;&#1072;&#1096; &#1074;&#1086;&#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1089;.</span><br/></blockquote><p><br/>Which roughly translates as following:<br/></p><blockquote><br/>We hope that Support will answer your question in a fast and competent manner.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>Great!

      <title>Why I think Thinking Weeks are stupid</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/7/26/why-i-think-thinking-weeks-are-stupid.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About.com has an <a href="http://humanresources.about.com/od/motivationsucces3/a/learn_read.htm">article</a>  up about how Bill Gates of Microsoft collects the papers from his employees, reads and thinks on them and answers to their respectful authors (or the whole company, I guess, if the idea is particularly good) during his Thinking Week twice a year. Not even family friends allowed to interrupt the Master. I think it's bullshit!</p><br/><p>First of all, twice a year? Are you kidding me?! Why not once a decade? After all, thinking is pretty darn difficult and one needs time to recuperate! Second of all, it doesn't matter how smart a person might be, one should be pretty ignorant and self-absorbed to think that he could go through some 100 papers a week, stay focused during the process, recognize opportunities and produce conscious business decisions <strong>on his own</strong>!</p><br/><p>The article then continues with Ten Commandments or as they call it -- "Ten Thinking and Dreaming Exercises for Creativity and Innovation". Some of them make sense -- read a lot of non-fiction, write down your thoughts, take time to reflect. And some of them are pretty laughable -- create "idea files" in most folders in your computer.</p><br/><p>What I would do differently? Immitating Microsoft's own Steve Ballmer -- conversations, conversations, conversations! Create online forums, IM and/or IRC chat-rooms, mailling lists, wikis, blogs, podcasts and whatnot for employees to communicate their ideas and discuss them <strong>amongst themselves</strong>. Encourage people to hang out in those media to chat and reflect <strong>publicly</strong> -- they are going to read blogs and exchange messages on company's time anyway, so why not let them give something back in return? And finally, <strong>listen</strong> and <strong>participate</strong> in those discussions and <strong>delegate</strong> big chunks of decision making to your employees, who are in many cases smarter and more experienced than you are and are <strong>much closer</strong> to your customers.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Conversation, especially in a large team, is a lot like breathing—it has to be coordinated and it has to be going on all the time. When your body is under stress, breathing takes more time and energy, but it's barely noticeable when you're relaxed.<br/>That's not to say I don't agree with you, Michael. But if you cannot finish the race, it is silly to blame heavy panting. It is just an indication of either a poor health or a mismanagement.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Podcasting support in iTunes</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/6/29/podcasting-support-in-itunes.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcasting support in iTunes 4.9 is great! But I have a complaint (you saw this coming, didn't you) about the way they handle podcasts on the library level. Although they assign Podcast genre to all downloaded files, the titles do not show up in the Library and so you cannot create smart playlists to manage them. I used to have a very elaborate structure of smart playlists to handle podcasts. A lot of it was redundant and I am glad it's gone and I won't need to delete old podcasts semi-manualy every so often, for example. But also I was managing the load by splitting podcasts in groups and categories and now it's gone as well and I am not very happy about that.</p><br/><p><b>Update:</b> I just wanted to add that in spite of any number of complaints that I might have, iTunes supporting podcasting is HUGE and I cannot be happier they did it! In fact, I completely switched to iTunes to be my podcast-catching client of choice after just a few minutes of playing with it.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Switching hosting</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/5/4/switching-hosting.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in the process of switching the hosting provider (again). This weblog is going to be moved last, so if everything else is down, come here for news. But hopefully the transition will be smooth and seamless.</p><br/><p><b>Update:</b> As mentioned in the footer of this weblog it is now powered by <a href="http://www.he.com">Hurricane Electric</a>. I also wanted to take this opportunity and re-factor my Runner's Log a bit. As a result, not everything is working there at the moment. But on the plus side, I'll have a much tidier code and thus it's gonna be much easier for me to add new exciting functionality to my log (more on that later).</p><br/><p>All that is left now is to switch the mail server to the new host and pull the plug on the old hosting.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Salted Salmon, Russian style</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/4/25/salted-salmon-russian-style.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>You're sick and tired of drinking your Bud and want to turn it up a notch to start enjoying your life again? First of all, <strong>don't drink cheap beer</strong>! And to top it off, here's one of my favorite family recipes.<br/></p><p><br/><strong>Fine Russian-style salted salmon<br/><br /></strong><br/></p><p><br/>You'll need:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>1 package of fresh salmon from Costco (~$11) sans 5 'tail' inches</li><br/><li>1 jar of kosher flake salt from Trader Joe's (about 75 grams)</li><br/><li>2 tbsp assorted whole pepper (black, white, whatever)</li><br/><li>bay leaf ad libitum</li><br/></ul><p><br/>Cut the remaining piece of fish in half, wash it and dry it with paper towels. Rub pieces of fish with salt. Sprinkle a little bit of salt and peppers onto the bottom of the pot, and lay one of the pieces flat on the bottom of pot. Take some peppers and press them into the fish, then sprinkle some salt onto it.  Lay the other piece of fish right on top oh the first one. Repeat the procedure with pepper and salt. You should use up all salt and pepper by this moment. Place a saucer or a small plate on top of the fish stack, and put some weight on it (half-gallon of water in some container will do just fine). Let the pot stand uncovered on the kitchen counter for half a day (room temperature) and then move it (still uncovered) to the fridge. In another 36 hours the fish is ready to be served and enjoyed with your favorite brand of Czech beer!<br/></p><p><br/>Now life is delish, isn't it?<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>6 mph. Running or Jogging?</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/4/6/6-mph-running-or-jogging.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Yesterday at 2:30 AM as I was setting the alarm-clock before going to bed I thought to myself - they say a grown man should sleep eight hours a day, but shouldn't you also count the time that passes between the moment you go to bed and the moment you actually fall asleep? And is there a distinct moment when one crosses the line between being awake and being asleep?<br/></p><p><br/>Anyway, this is not why I am writing this post. Somebody came to my weblog via Google inquiring "is 6 mph running or jogging"? Why do you care, curious stranger? The difference is only in the word (and a few snobbish runners believing that there is a difference). Some might say that a jogger is the one who doesn't care about the speed. In this sense, since you're asking, 6 mph is definitely running. Have many pleasant miles and stay injury-free – the only thing you <strong>should</strong> care about!<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Password manager</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/4/5/password-manager.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>What's the best password manager out there? <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/products/passwordsplus/">Passwords Plus</a> from <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/">DataViz</a>, that's what!<br/></p><p><br/>I spent a lot of time and effort trying to find a suitable cross-platform password manager and I believe my search is finally over. Passwords Plus is a nice and simple (very simple!) application that runs either on Mac OS or Windows and can be sync'ed with Palm OS or Pocket PC (as of right now Pocket PC syncs with Windows only). You can have up to ten custom-named fields in each record, and when you create a new item you are presented with a list of customizable templates, so that you don't have to type the same field names over and over again. There's the master password you have to enter when you launch the application, and the program locks itself after a user-defined period of inactivity.<br/></p><p><br/>Of course, Passwords Plus allows you to import your passwords from a dozen of other password managers, but the program I was using before did not have any export feature, so I had to type in by hand a couple of hundreds passwords and PINs, credit card numbers, bank accounts, serial numbers, you name it. Thankfully, for the last time, because Passwords Plus will not tie you down - just export your stuff to a .csv file and do what you please with it!<br/></p><p><br/>I noticed only one tiny problem - I deleted a category from the middle of the list and it messed up all category assignments - silly bug, I am sure they will fix it in the next build. So be warned, but do not let it stop you from downloading this awesome application.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>At work we use a free password manager, CyberScrub KeyChain password Manager <a href="<a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cyberscrub.com/keychain"">http://www.cyberscrub.com/keychain"</a> rel="nofollow"><a target="new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cyberscrub.com/keychain">http://www.cyberscrub.com/keychain</a></a> and we really love it. Here is some info I copied from their site:<br/>Manage ALL Passwords with One Phrase. When you log on to KeyChain with your Master Pass Phrase you will have instant access to all of your password protected websites. Select your destination from a special list you have created- then simply "Click &amp; Go". It's that easy! Each time you visit a site requiring a user name and password KeyChain auto enters this information and logs you in. It even prompts you to add these passwords to the program if you have not already done so. Never manually fill in credit card details again. Online shopping is a snap because KeyChain automatically enters your selected credit card details, Shipping and Billing address and more. All of your data is secured with strong encryption. Only you have access to the sensitive data within KeyChain. All information, including passwords, credit cards and other data, is protected with strong encryption algorithms. The USB flash drive also synchronizes with your host computer to back up your encrypted password list. This is an important feature should your PC crash or fail. You may also utilize the USB flash drive, if desired, for Dual User Authentication. This requires the user to not only enter the Master Pass Phrase, but also to plug the USB flash drive into their computer. Easy to use, backed award winning CyberScrub Customer Support.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Running outdoors</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/4/2/running-outdoors.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Yesterday I was running outdoors for the first time since high school (I did <a href="/running/entry/2005/02/24">run</a> once along the beach about a month ago, but that hardly qualifies as a run as I walked most of the distance). I made a few discoveries:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>My mouth generates torrents of spit &#8211; something that never bothered me while I was running solely on a treadmill.</li><br/><li>Despite the common understanding that a treadmill is easier on your joints, running on the concrete pavement caused me far less pain in joints, I guess the reason being  the multiformity. The monotonous repetitive nature of a treadmill had been wearing out my joints more than a slightly more hazardous but diverse terrain.</li><br/><li>My legs ached however in ways I had never experienced before. But that was a good ache, it means some abandoned muscles are now getting their workout as well.</li><br/><li>I can't tell whether I am running slow enough to last even the shortest distance. I need some way of figuring out my pace and controlling it.</li><br/></ul><p><br/>All in all, I had a great time running outdoors and am planning to do it more often now (if not always).<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Runner's Log III</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/2/17/runners-log-iii.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>After trying a few runner's log applications and not finding what I needed I've decided to write one myself. I want to automate as much as possible. Obviously, for that I will need some type of tracking device to record the speed and/or distance and possibly the heart rate. Additionally, I want the app to be able to publish the workout information on the weblog. I am in the slow planning mode right now and I will appreciate any input. Please leave a comment if you'd like me to implement some dream feature of yours.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Taxonomy</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/2/4/taxonomy.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Everybody seems to be talking about taxonomies these days. Not that I have anything new to say - I know about the topic no more than the next guy - but in my everlasting quest for better tags I keep bumping into a few questions that I don't see answered anywhere.<br/></p><p><br/>Do we need to develop a culture of proper tagging? If yes, what that culture might look like? Do we even know the answers to these questions?<br/></p><p><br/>I seem to be having two different approaches to tagging. Subconsciously I tend to think differently when I post to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr.com</a> than when I post to <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. For example, when I add a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/philrobin/conversation/index.html">bookmark to Conversation</a> - an IRC client for the Mac OS X - I use the following tags: "<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mac">mac</a>", "<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/internet">internet</a>", "<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/communication">communication</a>", "<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/tool">tool</a>". In other words I try to stay as concise and to be as generic as possible. Probably, because I want to have a relatively small and manageable list of tags, so that the next time I need a list of resources related to programming for Mac, I could just type in "<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mac+programming">mac programming</a>" and – voilà! – I have it. Sketchy, but you probably get the idea.<br/></p><p><br/>On the other hand, when I post a picture of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sudarkoff/2395466/" title="Self portrait on Flickr.com">me snorkeling</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr.com</a>, I let my imagination loose and put down almost every possible keyword that describes the tiniest of the details of the image as well as the story behind it: "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/vacation">vacation</a>", "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/snorkeling">snorkeling</a>", "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/portrait">portrait</a>", "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/diving">diving</a>", "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/water">water</a>", "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/yellow">yellow</a>", etc. I figure, if I want to capture the meaning (other than what you can immediately see in the picture) I've got to be elaborate about it.<br/></p><p><br/>Finally, how do we better utilize this sudden outburst of information? How do we make it work for regular chaps like myself? Doing "<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/a-word">tag:a-word</a>" search on <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati.com</a>, although entertaining at times, doesn't seem to do the job yet. It yields some interesting results but I have a feeling that we are missing on a much bigger picture here. Somewhere in that plethora of metadata lies the truth, but it's not in the form of a single tag. We definitely need to look at the collective dance of words and how they interconnect with each other.<br/></p><p class="tags"><br/>{<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/taxonomy" rel="tag">taxonomy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/metadata" rel="tag">metadata</a>}<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Da Vinci Code</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/1/30/the-da-vinci-code.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/">"The Da Vinci Code" (Dan Brown)</a>, among the last people on this planet, I guess; and I should tell you - if you are hesitating whether to read it or not - do not hesitate! I have been enjoying the book for three nights in a row, unable to put it aside. I must confess that I never thought highly of the Christian Church, or any kind of church for that matter, I believe that true faith does not need an institution. In fact, some ten years ago I was a member of a [not so secret] <a href="http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_info.html">society</a> of sorts which Russian Orthodox Church despises and considers to be a cult, no less. But regardless of whether you believe the facts laid out in the book are accurate, the novel itself is a very well crafted piece of writing! And a fair amount of controversy makes it even better.<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new kind of spam stroke my website yesterday -- a wiki-spam. ACL doesn't help very much (although I am making everything I can unmutable right now), because it forces a more restrictive setup which goes against the very idea of Wiki - anyone can modify pages. So far the assumption was that "anyone" includes only humans and that it is much easier to restore the site's content than to destroy it. Spam-bots just entered the picture and it changes everything!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>How many factual errors could you spot in the following excerpt:<br/></p><blockquote><br/>Your temporary 6 digit PIN has been set to your Date of Birth (MMDDY); for example, if your DOB is February 6, 1964, your PIN will be 020564.<br/></blockquote><p><br/>And although you might think that despite the number of errors in this instruction the correct way of composing the PIN is still quite obvious, let me assure you it is not true. Apparently, they made another error while implementing all this:<br/></p><blockquote><br/><strong>Error: Invalid Login Attempt, Please Try Again...</strong><br/></blockquote><p><br/>And so I tried a few more times and after five unsuccessfull logins, my account was blocked and I had to call Help Desk, submit the ticket and wait.

      <title>Evolution</title>
      <link>/blog/2005/1/13/evolution.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>While listening to Jerry Fiddler on ITConversations I thought: The real world evolves by implementing millions of changes at a time and then seeing which ones survive. This is almost the opposite of what we think of evolution in software development. Is there a value in adopting the real-life approach to software and how do we do it?<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Internet Explorer for Windows</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/12/15/internet-explorer-for-windows.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br/>Some of you have probably noticed that my website does not look pretty in the Internet Explorer for Windows. A pity but it is probably going to stay this way for a while. Although I am not one of those guys trashing IE on every occasion, urging everyone to switch to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> (though, <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3374931">you probably should</a> anyway), and I'd really love my site to look equally good in all browsers, the reality is - I don't have neither the time nor the skills to make it work in every single browser out there and I have better and more important things to do. Besides, IE for Windows is the only problematic browser at the moment. So, hereby I extend my apologies to all 1.07% of my readers who use IE!<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Evil Software Architects</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/12/8/evil-software-architects.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><br/><a href="http://devx.com/opinion/Article/22649">To Software Architects: Serve End Users, Not Your Egos</a><br/><br />"When the architect job title slipped into the software development lexicon, software engineers became more concerned with building ego-driven monuments than functional skyscrapers."<br/></blockquote><p><br/>I almost entirely agree with David on this subject – Software Architects shall not abuse their powers! On the other hand, I don't see this happening often enough to be a real problem. More frequently developers lack guidance of the knowledgeable architect and thus spend enormous amount of time integrating their individual pieces written in total isolation, hacking the system in an effort to add a new "unexpected" feature, etc. I'd say, the problem is not architects using obscure language and creating academically sound, but practically unacceptable architectures, I'd say the problem is lack of experienced Software Architects, capable of establishing a proper level of communication within the team.<br/></p><p><br/>On the subject of obscure terminology, I strongly believe that a common language (be it UML, design patterns or even just slang that enough engineers understand) is a very important component in any engineering activity. Without it we'll keep waving our hands in the air, desperately trying to explain simple and obvious ideas. Ideas, that many of us have implemented numerous times in the past. Besides, "singleton" is so much shorter and easier to use in the sentence than "a class which is meant to be instantiated once, and only once" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton">Wikipedia.org</a>).<br/></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My sweetest dream for the last few years (of a technological kind, at least) was to have a full-blown home automation system. I want to be able to check my email, read news, program a DVR, AC or coffeemaker, and to control a security system, lights, music, etc. from any room in the house. And I want things happening automagically without me wasting my precious time. <em>I want technology to deliver on its decades-old promises already!</em></p><br/><p>Although this all sounds quite feasible there is one big "but" if you consider implementing it with the current state of things. To administer the system of this complexity will be a full-time job. And to become a servant of my own home automation system would be the biggest joke of all times!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Palm OS is dead</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/11/15/palm-os-is-dead.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was cleaning up the address book on my PDA the other day when I suddenly realized that Palm OS is going to die pretty soon! Yes, I think its days are counted and here's why.</p><br/><p>Programming for the Palm OS platform has a very distinct "embedded" smell to it. Memory management is a mess, supporting different screen resolutions is a major pain in the butt, and instead of a real file system developers have to deal with this stupid notion that everything is a database. There might have been reasons for it a few years ago but not anymore. And Palm fails to recognize this fact and deal with it appropriately.</p><br/><p>By no means am I an expert in Palm OS internals; I had only a brief encounter with it as a developer, but when I look at my Sony Clie UX50, I don't understand why oh why all these limitations. I remember my first computer - it had a 66 MHz processor, 4 MB of memory, 210 MB of disk space and yet it ran a multi-task operating system and all bells and whistles that came with it. Why on Earth does my PDA lag behind? It has a CPU twice as fast, a separate co-processor for dealing with multimedia (which it does pretty well, thanks to Sony), twenty-five times more RAM, a few times roomier "disk", etc...</p><br/><p>If the course of things sticks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" title="Moore's law. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.">Moore's law</a> for at least one year longer, Palm OS is going to be so out of touch with reality that it won't make any sense developing for it whatsoever. Heck, maybe that's why Sony is retrieving itself from this market?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Runner's Log II</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/10/12/runners-log-ii.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Runner's Log is up and running (pun intended). You can find it <a href="/running/" title="George's Runner's Log">here</a>. It has it's own <a href="/running/atom" title="Atom feed">Atom</a> feed (which even validates!), although I can't imagine someone interested in following my progress that close.</p><br/><p>Sadly, I couldn't find the clean and easy way to implement this kind of thing in <a href="http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a>, so I ended up coding everything in PHP-MySQL-Smarty. It went surprisingly easy, the whole project took only about three hours of work scattered throughout the two weeks of frequent but short coffee breaks. Of course with approach like this the result is a bunch of spaghetti code, but it's a tiny bits of spaghetti code, so even if I ever need to change/add anything it won't be a huge problem.</p><br/><p>Anyway, now that my Runner's Log is running, I am going to take a month off and stop running myself. I need to do it to give my knee a chance to heal completely. Until then, see you in the gym or in the swimming pool.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2004/9/20/runners-log.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about adding the runner's log to this weblog. Namely, I need to be able to log the course, distance, pace, easiness and brief note for each individual workout. Plus, track the mileage and performance of the sneackers I used in the workout. It would be nice to have the "database" of sneackers which will include the brand, name of the store I bought the pair from, price, thumbnail, short description, etc. and will remind me when it's time to buy a new pair.</p><br/><p>Are there any plugins that would allow me to do such thing in MovableType? Is this sort of functionality even possible to implement within the MT3 framework without patching it?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Running again</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/9/10/running-again.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am slowly starting running again after a month break due to a minor knee injury. This time I am set to avoid any injuries and here's how I am going to achieve it: <b>I will avoid pushing myself to the limit too soon</b>! Yes, it's that simple! In fact, I might stop pushing for speed all together. I've realized that I am in this neither for speed, nor for distance - I am in this for life, as one popular runners magazine puts it.</p><br/><div class="pullquote">...I am in this <b>neither for speed</b>, <b>nor for</b> distance...</div><br/><p>So, after a week and a half of running I have found my own pace and distance I am most comfortable with. I am running at speeds of six to seven miles per hour for about thirty to forty minutes. Twice I had walking breaks for a minute or two and it made all the difference in the world, so I am now going to do it more often.</p><br/><p>I am not setting any particular goals at the moment (other than avoiding injuries), however I thought about running a marathon in the past and I might start training for it when I feel comfortable enough with my current running schedule. If you happen to know about any upcoming marathons for a cancer research or any other good cause taking place in the San Francisco Bay Area in about six months to a year, please let me know.</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A little bad poetry</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/4/29/a-little-bad-poetry.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen). I've tried my hand at translating a couple of them into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability to express myself in a foreign landuage), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted a translation of the shortest and least rhymed one. Here's the result:</p>

<pre><code>    Your face is a ripe peach
    On it rottenness has no place
    Very, very boring face...
</code></pre>

<p>It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it's better rhymed now :-)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>- Χριστος Ανεστη! Христос воскресе! Christ Is Risen!<br /><br/>- Αληθως Ανεστη! Во истину воскресе! Indeed He Is Risen!</p><br/><p>Yesterday, my wife and I paid a visit to her relatives in San Francisco to join the celebration of Orthodox Pascha. Not a thing was missing, everything was in full accordance with the tradition. Lots of Russian food, vodka, kulich and pascha on the table and Father Yaroslav at the table :-)</p><br/><p>Most of my wife's relatives fled Russia eighty years ago. They first went to China, then Philippines, then Italy, then Paraguay and then some of them settled in the U.S. As a consequence, they now speak Chinese, Spanish, English, and Russian at the same time.</p><br/><p>It is amazing how Russian culture is preserved so well in those people in spite of their long multicultural jorney and in many cases never being to Russia in their life!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>RSS in the Palm of Your Hand</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/3/11/rss-in-the-palm-of-your-hand.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com">Palm Infocenter</a> posted a tiny little <a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=6595" title="RSS Syndication Tools for the Palm OS">review</a> of tools you can use to read <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> newsfeeds on the Palm.</p><br/><p><b>Online Readers</b><br /><br/>I was using <a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/hand_rss/">Hand/RSS</a> since the very first day they hit the market. Overall, it is a nice application and it performs its basic functions nearly flawlessly. But if you happen to have more than just a few feeds on your list and subscribe/unsubscribe often - help you god with managing all that. The subscriptions dialog is barely useful. Due to the fact that it shows only URLs, all you can see is just a bunch of "...logger.com/xml/rss.xml" strings. Not really helpful! Of course, you can tap on the line to see the details, but to do so just in order to decide which feeds to update, is a real pain. Guys from <a href="http://www.standalone.com/">Stand Alone</a> sent me a version supporting <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language (XML-based format for exchange of outline-structured information)">OPML</acronym> import (thanks, fellas!) and it did make the whole process a bit easier, but I still had to edit my OPML files manually for them to be imported correctly.</p><br/><p>People who wrote <a href="http://palminfocenter.palmgear.com/?xyz=49996">Ticker</a> obviously had too much free time on their hands and couldn't think of a good thing to do with it. As a consequence, I don't know what good things I could do with their program.</p><br/><p>Another choice that was not mentioned in the article is the <a href="http://bloglines.com/mobile/">Bloglines Mobile</a>. It's a version of <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> (web-based news aggregator) optimized for smaller browsers. I often use it when I lie down on the couch and don't feel like holding a laptop (which, by the way, gets quite warm after a few hours of browsing).</p><br/><p><b>Offline Readers</b><br /><br/>After many months of experimenting with different choices I ended up using (almost exclusively) <a href="http://jpluck.sourceforge.net/">JPluck X</a> in conjunction with the good ol' <a href="http://www.plkr.org/">Plucker</a>. You cannot update the feeds on the go (that's why I still have Hand/RSS hanging around), but it is a lot more manageable, and Plucker as a reader is superior to that of the Hand/RSS. Plus, with these tools you can read sites that do not have RSS feeds.</p><br/><p>I don't have personal experience with <a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/newsmac/index.html">News Mac 3</a>, but I guess, combined with <a href="http://www.isilo.com/">iSilo</a>, it's not much different from the previous set.</p><br/><p><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br/>If you have a good stable internet connection on your PDA, I'd recommend pointing your browser to <a href="http://bloglines.com/mobile/">Bloglines Mobile</a> for the best reading experience. If you want to download newsfeeds wirelessly and then read them offline, go with <a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/hand_rss/">Hand/RSS</a>. If you don't have internet on your PDA or prefer using an offline aggregator for some other reasons, <a href="http://jpluck.sourceforge.net/">JPluck X</a> + <a href="http://www.plkr.org/">Plucker</a> is the way to go.</p><br/><p><em>Update: Hand/RSS does show feed titles in the Subscriptions dialog. I'll check the OPML import feature tonight to see if I was wrong about the compatibility issue as well.</em></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Outsourcing American dream</title>
      <link>/blog/2004/1/28/outsourcing-american-dream.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Pink of Wired wrote an excellent piece on outsourcing high tech jobs:</p><br/><blockquote>"A century ago, 40 percent of Americans worked on farms. Today, the farm sector employs about 3 percent of our workforce. But our agriculture economy still outproduces all but two countries. Fifty years ago, most of the US labor force worked in factories. Today, only about 14 percent is in manufacturing. But we've still got the largest manufacturing economy in the world - worth about $1.9 trillion in 2002. We've seen this movie before - and it's always had a happy ending. The only difference this time is that the protagonists are forging pixels instead of steel. And accountants, financial analysts, and other number crunchers, prepare for your close-up. Your jobs are next. After all, to export sneakers or sweatshirts, companies need an intercontinental supply chain. To export software or spreadsheets, somebody just needs to hit Return." <a title="Wired 12.02: The New Face of the Silicon Age" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.02/india.html?pg=1;topic=;topic_set=">Read on</a><br/></blockquote><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2004/1/9/predictions-for-2004.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was chatting with a friend today and he showed me some quite lame list of "things that are likely to happen in year 2004 and change people's lives" (no less than that). And since <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/01/predictions-for-2004">everybody else</a> is making all sorts of predictions, I felt compelled to compose my very own list as well. Here goes my "top three":</p><br/><ol><br/><li>Scientists will finally come up with a way of "spraying" displays on practically any surface and manage to pass the knowledge to engineers.</li><br/><li>Storage will continue to grow byte-wise and to shrink inch-wise.</li><br/><li>Some Japanese company will put together a battery that will last longer, weigh less and take less room than a "regular one".</li><br/></ol><br/><p>All these combined will make lighter PDAs which I only care about. :-) So, what do you think of my list?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Programmer's Productivity</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/12/18/programmers-productivity.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I spent twelve hours hunting down a most bizarre bug. I flipped through literally thousands of lines of code, I set dozens of breakpoints only to realize that those places were being hit hundreds of times, and it is virtually impossible to debug it that way. I tried everything I could think of, but nothing helped and by the end of the day I was totally exhausted and pretty much ready to choke somebody. I made no progress whatsoever!</p><br/><p>So, at about 8 p.m. I decided to take a break. I stopped the hunt, prepared myself a tiny cup of light and at the same time velvety espresso made of South American premium Arabica beans, made myself comfortable, took a big sip of coffee and let my mind wander...</p><br/><p><i>...Ecstatic feelings started filling up my heart, the time paused, allowing me to experience every bit of the surrounding reality in vivid intricacy. I could touch the sound waves coming from two fans in my computer, I could taste every single red photon spitted out by the stupid optical mouse...</i></p><br/><p>I shook my head (nice coffee!) and, oh miracle, I spotted the defective piece of code in my mind. I immediately jumped to the computer, grabbed the keyboard and started typing...

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I do not believe in LOC as a measure of productivity at all. To illustrate my point I will give you two examples:<br/>(1) Engineer A developed a  library performing some quite extensive and relatively complicated calculations using numerical methods. He spent five weeks developing the algorithm, one week coding, three weeks debugging the flow and eight weeks tuning algorithm parameters. Outcome: one very stable library of two thousand lines of code (lots of templates, though).<br/>(2) Engineer B spent fifteen weeks coding (mostly control flow and GUI) and two weeks debugging. Outcome: one existing library was expanded with more than ten thousand lines of code, became very heavy, full of external dependencies, highly unstable and poorly manageable.<br/>Which engineer is more productive (weeks and LOCs are for demonstrational purposes only)?<br/>I realize that with everything else being equal, an engineer writing the same amount of code (that does the same thing) faster is more productive, but in real life LOC is the last thing I'd consider during the performance evaluation.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>In my experience, show stoppers are rarely features (or bugs) of great complexity. And thus the people responsible for not delivering on time are often not the developers, but those who commit features to the customer and those who prioritize the tasks.<br/>I knew a few programmers who would write two thousand lines of code per day and for the most part it was a nice working code, but when they needed to change something small, they would waste another day and write another thousand  lines of code.<br/>I like when people take their time at the beginning of the project to sort things out and stay concise along the way.<br/>So, again, what is the ultimate measure of a programmer's productivity?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I think, programmers productivity can be measured not only in LOC per day, but in LOC also. You can’t avoid code typing, GUI drawing, documenting and other physical actions.<br/>There are some measures:<br/>1) function points from UML model (can have wide range of complexity for programmer, but reminds, that program isn’t end in itself);<br/>2) function points from aggregative algorithm, flowchart, DFD, etc. (can be correctly viewed only after prototyping, but can have estimations of algorithm complexity, testing complexity, code length);<br/>3) LOC writing and other physical activity;<br/>4) code quality from positions of stability, effectiveness, structuring, documentation.<br/>I think, this measures must be applied at the same time.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Music: Beck Surfers</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/12/13/music-beck-surfers.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going through my 60+ Gig library of mp3's in search of something "fresh" to listen to, and a few minutes ago I accidently played Surfers' "Pepper" right after Beck's "Loser." On about 10th second of the song I realized that I had already heard these riffs. I was listening and I couldn't believe my ears - how could it be?!?! Then I spent a few minutes researching the matter, and here's what I found:</p><br/><p>This song is <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/butthole-surfers/electriclarryland.shtml">"... a cross pollination between Beck's "Loser" and Jim Carroll's "People Who Died.""</a> Thank God I am not crazy and it really does sound similar!</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Firewall Builder</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/4/16/firewall-builder.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org">Firewall Builder</a> is featured in May issue of the Linux Journal. It's interesting how often things that are right under your very nose are passing by unnoticed. A couple of my friends, Vadim Kurland and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/vzaliva/">Vadim Zaliva</a>, have been working on this tool for ages and I even remember Vadim Zaliva recommending it to me when I was having problems setting up my firewall properly (yes, I am a networks dummy). At the time I had a very old version of RedHat on my server, so I failed to install it. Later, I upgraded to RedHat 8.0 but somehow, I forgot about this wonderful program, and to add Wi-Fi segment to my home network I again had to go though the settings manually - it was such a pain!</p><br/><p>So I guess, now that they have been&nbsp;mentioned in the press twice (first time in some German <a href="http://www.linux-magazin.de/Artikel/ausgabe/2001/06/firewall/Firewall-GUI.html">Linux Magazin</a> in 2001), it's about time I gave Firewall Builder a try. :-)</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Energy Independence</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/4/1/energy-independence.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The USA and Israel are presenting inaugural conference on <a href="http://www.energycooperation.org/">Cooperation for Energy Independence of Democracies</a>.<br /><br/><blockquote>"Dependency on uncertain and interruptible energy supplies from Middle Eastern states is a crucial strategic issue that must be resolved to assure the long-term security of Israel, the United States and the world's other democracies.  The importation of these critical fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) is vulnerable to economic as well as physical attack.  The world's democracies spend billions of dollars each year trying to protect access to these resources.  In addition, the petrodollars that the suppliers receive often end up being used for purposes inimical to the interests of the world's democracies; these funds are used to purchase weapons, to support the spread of radical Islamicist thought, and to finance the spread of terrorism.  For all of these reasons, reducing dependency on fossil fuels is a critical and timely challenge for the world's democracies."</blockquote></p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Spam</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/3/31/spam.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have gotten 79 junk emails since yesterday! But for <a href="http://us.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> I would have been entirely exhausted trying to sort through this pile of dirt and annoyance. I have a feeling that unless we take radical measures as soon as possible, email might become unusable for the most part. We need something absolutely out of the ordinary. Something that either eliminates the very idea of unwanted mail, or makes it impossible to hide the source the junk is coming from. Am I dreaming?</p><br/><p>SpamAssassin is great but I spent almost two weeks tweaking it so that none of the good emails is lost. Yes, I know that smart people hide their real email addresses, but (1) I don't believe it solves the problem completely and (2) I don't like hiding. Is there hope, or do we have to suck it up and learn to live with it?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

I think that a <a href="http://guitargeek.com/gearview/524/">touch guitar</a> (or a <a href="http://www.stick.com/">Stick</a>) and a piano would go together as a very colorful duo! Two-handed tapping is quite a <a href="http://www.stick.com/articles/evolution/">powerful technique</a>, so it would be very interesting to see how Stick will go along with the king of all instruments - piano.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm standing here, looking at the ocean. I used to live on the other side of this thing, used to watch beautiful sunrises. Now I'm getting used to watching sunsets just as beautiful. The waves are coming to me as they were fifteen years ago - nothing changed. I traveled all the way from the Far East to the Wild West and the ocean is still the same. No matter East or West, peace or war - <em>Pacific</em> Ocean is the same.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New location</title>
      <link>/blog/2003/3/11/new-location.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've decided to move my blog to this <a href="http://george.sudarkoff.com" title="What I Write Is What I See" target="_blank">new location</a> for two reasons: (1) to give <a href="http://movabletype.org" title="Movable Type" target="_blank">Movable Type</a> a try and (2) to separate family news from my personal blog. I've seen <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com" title="Chris Pirillo ~ Getting Screwed While Everybody Else is Getting Laid" target="_blank">Chris Pirillo</a> <a href="http://pirillo.com" title="pirillo.com" target="_blank">do this</a> succesfully and I thought that this scheema would fit my situation as well.</p><br/><p>I'll try to invest more effort in our <a href="http://sudarkoff.com" title="Sudarkoffs' Virtual Home" target="_blank">family site</a>; and I'll do it mostly in Russian because 90 per cent of our readers are our friends and relatives from Russia. I don't think I will have enough time to translate everything into English though. Unless my wife is willing to help. ;)</p><br/><p>...Why on Earth am I writing in English? Good question!.. Short answer: I don't know. Sure, English is the language I'm still learning, but so is Russian :)... Probably, writing in English switches something in my head. For some strange reason I cannot blog in Russian. For me it's like swearing in French... Or maybe I just want to be heard by a bigger crowd?</p><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>WIWIWIS - What I Write Is What I See</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To find a simple yet distinctive name for a new thing is not only an important task but a very difficult one as well. I have been considering different names for my blog for days now. I tried "George's Blog" (yes, it is simple), "Sudarkoffs' Weblog", "Couch News" and a few others - anything but distinctive. Finally, I opened a nice little <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com">program</a>, which I use to write my blogs. The program is WYSIWYG which made me think: "Wow! WIWIWIS is just what I was looking for". "<b>W</b>hat <b>I</b> <b>W</b>rite <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat <b>I</b> <b>S</b>ee" is exactly what this blog is all about. I am not trying to enlighten the world with whatever essential knowledge I might possess or to show off my great talent (who am I kidding, right!?). I'm like a Plato's fool - I speak not because I have something to say, but because I have to say something. So here I go!

      <title>One mistake that will destroy your marriage</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/5/11/one-mistake-that-will-destroy-your-marriage.html</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget about all those &#8220;10 common mistakes&#8221; and &#8220;12 helpful tips&#8221;. Here&#8217;s just <strong>one</strong> mistake that is virtually guaranteed to destroy your marriage. Avoid it and you have a pretty good chance to &#8220;live happily ever after&#8221;. Ready for it? Here it goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protecting your marriage no matter what <br />
  is virtually guaranteed to destroy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Say what? Aren&#8217;t we trying to protect our marriage here?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain what I mean by that. But first, let me ask you this - what do you expect from your marriage? What was the purpose of you marrying? Let&#8217;s leave the religious, insurance and tax considerations aside for a moment. And please try to dig deeper. Raising children together is a fantastic goal, but imagine for a second that the two of you are unable to have kids and adoption is not an option. Does your marriage ceases to matter? I hope not. I&#8217;ll give you a minute to think this through and will go pour myself a cup of tea in the meantime&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>​Hello, my name is&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_(given_name)">George</a>. The name origin is Greek (Γεώργιος) and it means “farmer”: Γεώ – “earth”, εργο – “to work”. In Russian, which is my native language, it is Георгий (or Гоша, Жора and even Егор)—can you tell that Cyrillic alphabet was derived from Greek? But my russian friends call me Yura (Юра) or Yuri (Юрий)—it is much shorter, easier to pronounce and that is what I have in my Russian passport too. In Japanese, Yuri (ユリ) means “lily” and is often used to refer to all things lesbian.</p><p>I am a software developer by trade. Since the early nineties I’ve been writing software professionally and nowadays I enjoy it even more, because many more things are possible thanks to advances in the field. I have a full time job at a big networking company, and I also do various projects on the side. Often, my side projects are related to my hobbies, which include&nbsp;<a href="http://george.sudarkoff.com/ha/">electronics</a>, ham radio, rock climbing, running, biking, yoga,&nbsp;<a href="http://george.sudarkoff.com/cooking/">cooking</a>, playing musical instruments, writing,&nbsp;<a href="http://george.sudarkoff.com/make/">making physical things</a>&nbsp;and various&nbsp;<a href="http://george.sudarkoff.com/journal/">other pursuits</a>.</p><p>​</p>]]></content:encoded>
