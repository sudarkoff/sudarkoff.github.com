Unfortunately, the conditions on their native planet are extremely severe and they all look kinda ugly. Their eyes are covered with a thick layer of skin because the sun in their world is a million times brighter than on Earth. So wherever they go, they carry around a gazillion-watt lighting system and of course lot's of living creatures are just simply die in this conditions. That leads to a lot of misunderstandings. Finally, they arrive on Earth. This short story is the cronicle of their brief visit.
