Title: What I Talk About When I Talk About Climbing

Let me try to explain to you why I climb. I have been doing it since September of 2008, I think. And every week I don't climb, I feel is a week wasted. So what is it that makes rock climbing so important to me?

For me climbing is just it. There isn't anything I expect to get from it. I might  dream about improving my technique and climbing harder, but those are all secondary goals that make the activity itself more enjoyable. In the end I climb because I love climbing.

Undoubtedly, climbing makes me stronger both physically and mentally. But I do not climb to get stronger. Climbing also teaches me how not to poop my pants when it gets really scary. ... And there's nothing like leading a runout slab to make me fully present and 100 percent focused. But I do not climb to learn to be present.

I do not climb to achieve any of the above goals. Though I do get stronger, more resilient to stress and more present. But if I was expecting any of these benefits to happen, but didn't see a progress quickly enough, I might have become discouraged, started doubting myself, wondering if I'm "doing it right". That does not sound like fun.

Most people have some hobby or activity that makes them feel alive. I know some runners that would keep running even if their limbs started falling off. I myself certainly have been known to climb with a broken foot, a torn meniscus or a thrown back.

Is it then an unhealthy obsession? Maybe even an addiction? Perhaps! But if the addiction makes you feel alive, wouldn't that make you addicted to life? And is it still a bad thing then?

I'd say it becomes unhealthy if it affects your life and your relationships in a negative way. If you need a visit to a therapist every time you fail to send your project, then your obsession is an unhealthy one. But if you get relaxed, more sure of yourself, think straighter and smile more often - then I would have a hard time calling your passion an addiction.

The only thing that matters is how you spend your time. Right here and right now.

If you focus too much on looking for one thing, you'll miss many other things.
