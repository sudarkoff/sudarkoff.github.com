I&rsquo;ve tried my hand at translating a couple into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability on my part), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted to translate the shortest and least rhymed one. Here&rsquo;s the result:</p><pre><code>Your face is a ripe peach
On it rottenness has no place
Very, very boring face...
</code></pre><p>It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it&rsquo;s better rhymed now :-)</p><div id=footer><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/sudarkoff>LinkedIn</a> | <a rel=me href=https://hachyderm.io/@sudarkoff>Mastodon</a><br>George Sudarkoff &copy; 2019-2023</div></body></html>
