I&rsquo;ve tried my hand at translating a couple into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability on my part), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted to translate the shortest and least rhymed one. Here&rsquo;s the result:</p><pre><code>Your face is a ripe peach
On it rottenness has no place
Very, very boring face...
</code></pre><p>It has lost a bit of meaning and rhythm, but it&rsquo;s better rhymed now :-)</p></article></div></section><aside id=meta><div><section><div>Jan 1, 0001 | 109 Words</div></section></div><div><a class=previous href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buckwheat-pancakes-recipe/>Buckwheat pancakes</a>
