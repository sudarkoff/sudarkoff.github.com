Cooking is a big part of our family life, and I wanted my future son to be able to participate in this activity.</p><p><img src=paper-sketch.jpeg alt="pencil sketch"></p><p>The idea was to build the tower out of 3/4-inch plywood, using only my table saw, a router, and a drill press. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with in SketchUp:</p><p><img src=3d-sketch.jpeg alt="3d sketch"></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to use the traditional woodworking joinery, like a box joint. I wanted to be able to disasemmble and store or transport the tower flat. So I decided to go the Ikea way and use the bolts to hold the pieces of plywood together. I already had plenty of bolts, but not the barrel nuts. And instead of ordering the nuts from McMaster-Carr I decided to whip up a home-made version from the materials I had on hand. I had a 3/4-inch steel pipe, so I cut it into the appropriately sized pieces and drilled and tapped the holes.</p><p><img src=making-hardware.jpeg alt="making hardware"></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the final result:</p><p><img src=hardware.jpeg alt=hardware></p><p>And here&rsquo;s a test piece to make sure my home-made joinery would work:</p><p><img src=testing-joinery.jpeg alt="testing joinery"></p><p>After cutting the pieces and sanding the edges, I put a few layers of varnish on everything:</p><p><img src=varnish.jpeg alt="putting on varnish"></p><p>And here&rsquo;s the activity tower assembled:</p><p><img src=activity-tower-assembled.jpeg alt="assembled activity tower"></p><p>And a few months later, as soon as my son was able to stand on his own, he was helping aroud the kitchen. Here he&rsquo;s helping me wash the dishes:</p><p><img src=kid-using-the-tower.jpeg alt="kid in the tower by the sink"></p></article></div></section><aside id=meta><div><section><div id=post-date>May 5, 2012 | 241 Words</div></section><ul id=tags><li><a href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/tags/woodworking>woodworking</a></li></ul></div><div><a class=previous href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/markdown-plus-pandoc-workflow/>Markdown + Pandoc Workflow</a>
