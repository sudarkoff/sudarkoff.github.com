Full history With Git, every repository contains a full copy of the project history, and no repository is inherently more important than any other.
Content-addressable Git stores content in files with names that are 40-hexdigit (160-bit) SHA1 hashes. This has some interesting implications. It means for example that Git will never store the same data twice within a repository because identical data would have identical SHA1 hashes and therefore be stored in the same file.</div><div><a href=/posts/key-git-concepts/>Read more…</a></div><h2>A little bad poetry</h2><div>As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen). I&rsquo;ve tried my hand at translating a couple into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability on my part), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted to translate the shortest and least rhymed one.</div><div><a href=/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/>Read more…</a></div><h2>Turtles in my navel</h2><div>Turtles in my navel are having an argument: “It’s not my turn to take out the trash,” hisses Greg, “why do you insist that it is?” A vein on his right temple is pulsing a steady 60 beats per minute; he manages to stay mostly calm – he loves Patricia, after all.
The sun just popped up from behind my left breast. The snails of the morning chill are chased away by the spreading beams of warmth.</div><div><a href=/posts/turtles-in-my-navel/>Read more…</a></div></ul></main><div id=footer><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/sudarkoff>LinkedIn</a> | <a rel=me href=https://hachyderm.io/@sudarkoff>Mastodon</a><br>George Sudarkoff &copy; 2019-2023</div></body></html>
