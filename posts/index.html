And they judge harshly those who can&rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.</p></section></div><div class=meta>Feb 15, 2023 | 225 Words | <a href=/posts/yield-to-temptation/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/distributed-ops-proposal/>Distributed Ops for Distributed Apps</a></h2><div><section><p><em>My proposal for a talk I delivered at Velocity Amsterdam, 2016.

But how much stack is &ldquo;the whole stack&rdquo;? How do we ensure that operational standards are consistent across the organization? What&rsquo;s the right balance between consistent standards and the ability to move fast?</p></section></div><div class=meta>Feb 10, 2016 | 368 Words | <a href=/posts/distributed-ops-proposal/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/crepes-recipe/>Crêpes</a></h2><div><section><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>3 eggs</li><li>1 pinch of salt</li><li>3 tbs of brown sugar</li><li>30g of butter</li><li>200g of all purpose flower</li><li>0.5L of whole milk</li><li>1 generous splash of Amaretto (alt: vanilla extract, Rhum, any other flavorful booze)</li></ul><h2 id=method>Method</h2><h3 id=batter>Batter</h3><ol><li>Beat the eggs</li><li>Add the sugar and salt, and stir well</li><li>Add the melted butter, and stir well</li><li>Add some flour until the batter gets more uniform and then add some milk to make it smooth, continue until all flour rand milk have been added</li><li>Add Amaretto</li><li>Let the batter rest for an hour</li></ol><h3 id=cooking>Cooking</h3><ol><li>You will need a ladle, some melted butter in a small container and a brush to oil the pan</li><li>Set the pan on a medium heat</li><li>Brush the pan with a little bit of melted butter (repeat every 5-6 crêpes)</li><li>Using the ladle, pour some batter onto the pan while tilting and turning it to cover the entire surface of the pan with batter</li><li>Take care not to make it too thick, these are not pancakes!</li><li>Once the edges of the batter start to lift and the crêpe does not stick to the pan anymore, turn it over</li><li>Let the crêpe cook for a minute more, then slide it to a warm plate and optionally brush some butter on it</li></ol></section></div><div class=meta>Jan 29, 2015 | 214 Words | <a href=/posts/crepes-recipe/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/scripting-vs-automation/>Scripting versus automation</a></h2><div><section><p><em>This was originally shared with the engineering org of a company I worked for at the time.

This has some interesting implications. It means for example that Git will never store the same data twice within a repository because identical data would have identical SHA1 hashes and therefore be stored in the same file. It also means that the contents of a Git object will never change because that would change the name the object is stored under.</p></section></div><div class=meta>May 23, 2013 | 1439 Words | <a href=/posts/key-git-concepts/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/>Fitness Proportionate Disk Selection</a></h2><div><section><p><em>This is a proposal I made for improving the disk selection algorithm of a distributed file storage system.</em></p><h2 id=current-disk-selection-algorithm>Current Disk Selection Algorithm</h2><p>The current algorithm randomly selects a disk among the top N percent and assigns it to a given equivalence class. This strategy is suboptimal for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li>Even when there&rsquo;s a great variability of fitness values among the top N percent of the disks, the most suitable disks will have the same probability of being selected as the least suitable disks, thus leading to unbalanced placement. Simply decreasing the value of N is not sufficient to resolve the problem, as it is always possible to have a situation when the fitness variability is great regardless of how small the N is.</li><li>When nearly all disks in the pool have similar fitness values, they all deserve equal chance, yet only the top N percent will be considered. It&rsquo;s tempting to assume that the next round of placements will favor a different set of disks. But the selection of the next eligible set is determined by the weights that each fitness parameter is assigned. And it is possible that the same group of disks will be used for placement for a while, thus, once again, leading to unbalanced placement.</li></ol><p>Undoubtedly, we would like to preserve some randomness in the selection algorithm to minimize the chances of overwhelming the same disks and nodes with placements and IO. But for reasons stated above, a fitness proportionate selection algorithm is more desirable.</p></section></div><div class=meta>May 1, 2013 | 507 Words | <a href=/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Rock climbing lessons</a></h2><div><section><p>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.</p><h2 id=dont-give-up>Don&rsquo;t give up</h2><p>Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there. If you are persistent and don&rsquo;t give up, you sooner or later find your groove and come on top victorious.</p></section></div><div class=meta>Nov 5, 2012 | 1337 Words | <a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Read more…</a></div></div><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></main><div id=footer><hr><div><a href=https://sudarkoff.com><img alt=Coaching src=/img/gs-logo.svg></a>&nbsp;
