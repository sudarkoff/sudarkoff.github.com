Description 400 characters
In the world of microservices, when things are moving fast and constantly breaking, the accepted wisdom is that teams must own the whole stack and operate their services themselves. But how much stack is &amp;ldquo;the whole stack&amp;rdquo;? How do we ensure that operational standards are consistent across the organization? What&amp;rsquo;s the right balance between consistent standards and the ability to move fast?</description></item><item><title>Scripting versus automation</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/scripting-vs-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2014 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/scripting-vs-automation/</guid><description>This was originally shared with the engineering org of a company I worked for at the time. It&amp;rsquo;s my stream of consciousness about the type of system my team was building at the time. Reproducing here without modifications, enjoy the chaos of my unedited remblings.
Team,
It became clear to me in the last few days that there&amp;rsquo;s not enough clarity about what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build.
We keep talking about relatively small and specific things, but we never discuss the philosophy behind it all.</description></item><item><title>Key Git concepts</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/key-git-concepts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 20:46:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/key-git-concepts/</guid><description>Understanding a few key concepts will help you make sense of how Git works and how to use it effectively.
Full history With Git, every repository contains a full copy of the project history, and no repository is inherently more important than any other.
Content-addressable Git stores content in files with names that are 40-hexdigit (160-bit) SHA1 hashes. This has some interesting implications. It means for example that Git will never store the same data twice within a repository because identical data would have identical SHA1 hashes and therefore be stored in the same file.</description></item><item><title>Fitness Proportionate Disk Selection</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/fitness-proportionate-disk-selection/</guid><description>This is a proposal I made for improving the disk selection algorithm of a distributed file storage system.
Current Disk Selection Algorithm The current algorithm randomly selects a disk among the top N percent and assigns it to a given equivalence class. This strategy is suboptimal for a couple of reasons:
Even when there&amp;rsquo;s a great variability of fitness values among the top N percent of the disks, the most suitable disks will have the same probability of being selected as the least suitable disks, thus leading to unbalanced placement.</description></item><item><title>Rock climbing lessons</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</guid><description>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.
Don&amp;rsquo;t give up Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&amp;rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&amp;rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there.</description></item><item><title>Rock climbing First-Aid kit</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rock-climbing-first-aid-kit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/rock-climbing-first-aid-kit/</guid><description>Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, yadda-yadda-yadda. Simply having a first-aid kit in your pack is neither going to keep you safe, nor magically save somebody’s life if you have no idea how to use it. If you climb outdoors, do yourself a favor and take a Wilderness First Aid or a similar class.
First of all, your kit should be appropriate for your level of training and for the environment you’re going to find yourself in.</description></item><item><title>Markdown + Pandoc Workflow</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/markdown-plus-pandoc-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/markdown-plus-pandoc-workflow/</guid><description>Requirements This article outlines my setup and workflow for writing documents using Markdown and pandoc. This is a workflow that I personally find natural and convenient. There are some very important limitations (discussed below), but I&amp;rsquo;ve been successfully using this workflow for quite some time and it seems to be working great.
Main requirements for my workflow were:
plain text editing keeping track of multiple revisions collaboration with multiple simultaneous remote and offline authors support for multiple target output formats automated publishing (through an external build system and such) Limitations Note that publishing is a one-way process in this workflow.</description></item><item><title>Buckwheat pancakes</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buckwheat-pancakes-recipe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2010 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buckwheat-pancakes-recipe/</guid><description>This is my favorite recipe for pancakes. I made it a dozen times in the last few months. Please note that ratios are given by weight, not volume. Invest in kitchen scale if you’re serious about cooking, they make getting consistent results so much easier.
Buckwheat pancakes are best enjoyed with honey and hot tea.
Ingredients (by weight) 1 part organic buckwheat flour 1 part whole wheat flour 2 parts milk 1 part eggs 1/2 part extra virgin olive oil salt and cinnamon to taste Method Separate egg whites from yokes.</description></item><item><title>Turtles in my navel</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/turtles-in-my-navel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2010 12:29:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/turtles-in-my-navel/</guid><description>Turtles in my navel are having an argument: “It’s not my turn to take out the trash,” hisses Greg, “why do you insist that it is?” A vein on his right temple is pulsing a steady 60 beats per minute; he manages to stay mostly calm – he loves Patricia, after all.
The sun just popped up from behind my left breast. The snails of the morning chill are chased away by the spreading beams of warmth.</description></item><item><title>Cherry Garcia ice cream</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/cherry-garcia-ice-cream-recipe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2010 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/cherry-garcia-ice-cream-recipe/</guid><description>I made this recipe a number of times and the results are always excellent!
Prep Time: 15 minutes Total Time: 30 minutes Ingredients 2 eggs 1/3 cup sugar 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup crushed dark chocolate 1/2 cup fresh cherries Method Place the crushed chocolate (tiny solid chunks taste better than shaved flakes which tend to soften or even dissolve) and the pitted and halved cherries (you can use canned cherries, but make sure to drain and dry them first) in separate bowls and refrigerate for a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Salted salmon</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/salted-salmon-recipe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/salted-salmon-recipe/</guid><description>Ingredients 1 package of fresh salmon from Costco (approx. $11) sans 5 &amp;rsquo;tail&amp;rsquo; inches 1 jar of kosher flake salt from Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s (about 75 grams) 2 tbsp assorted whole pepper (black, white, whatever) bay leaf ad libitum Method Cut the pieces of salmon in half, wash them and dry with paper towels. Rub some salt into salmon. Sprinkle some salt and peppers on the bottom of the pot, and lay the first piece of salmon flat in the pot.</description></item><item><title>A little bad poetry</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2004 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/</guid><description>As I was going through my archives the other day, I came across a few of my poems that I wrote in college (you know, everyone is a poet when nineteen). I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my hand at translating a couple into English and found it to be extremely difficult (mostly due to the lack of ability on my part), so I took it as a challenge, and attempted to translate the shortest and least rhymed one.</description></item><item><title>Анупадака Белый</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/andrew-bely/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 1995 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/andrew-bely/</guid><description>СИМВОЛИЗМ Символ есть знак или ознаменование. То, что он означает или знаменует, не есть какая-либо определенная идея.
Подобно солнечному лучу, символ прорезывает все планы бытия и все сферы сознания и знаменует в каждом плане иные сущности, исполняет в каждой сфере иное назначение.
Символика — система символов; символизм — искусство, основанное на символах. Оно вполне утверждает свой принцип, когда разоблачает сознанию вещи, как символы, а символы как мифы.
В искусстве, как и везде, можно проследить влияние двух начал: мужского и женского.</description></item><item><title>Миссия Будды</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buddha/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 1995 12:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/buddha/</guid><description>В историческом аспекте буддизм есть наиболее важная религия, хотя он не является таковой в аспекте философском. Это самое большое религиозное движение, гигантская духовная волна. Нет ни одной цивилизации, которая не ощутила бы на себе влияния буддизма.
Чтобы постичь суть учения Будды, нужно знать, что за события творились в Индии в тот момент. Необходимо понять, что представляло из себя индийское общество, когда индийская цивилизация достигла наивысшего расцвета. Легко заметить, что индийская цивилизация погибала и возрождалась неоднократно.</description></item></channel></rss>
