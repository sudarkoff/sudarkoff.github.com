Yes, I think its days are counted and here&rsquo;s why.</p><p>Programming for the Palm OS platform has a very distinct &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; smell to it. Memory management is a mess, supporting different screen resolutions is a major pain in the butt, and instead of a real file system developers have to deal with this stupid notion that everything is a database. There might have been reasons for it a few years ago but not anymore. And Palm fails to recognize this fact and deal with it appropriately.</p><p>By no means I am an expert in Palm OS internals; I had only a brief encounter with it as a developer, but when I look at my Sony Clie UX50, I don&rsquo;t understand why oh why all these limitations. I remember my first computer - it had a 66 MHz processor, 4 MB of memory, 210 MB of disk space and yet it ran a multi-task operating system and all bells and whistles that came with it. Why on Earth does my PDA lag behind? It has a CPU twice as fast, a separate co-processor for dealing with multimedia (which it does pretty well, thanks to Sony), twenty-five times more RAM, a few times roomier &ldquo;disk&rdquo;, etc&mldr;</p><p>If the course of things sticks to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>Moore&rsquo;s law</a> for at least one year longer, Palm OS is going to be so out of touch with reality that it won&rsquo;t make any sense developing for it whatsoever. Heck, maybe that&rsquo;s why Sony is retrieving itself from this market?</p></article></div></section><aside id=meta><div><section><div id=post-date>Nov 15, 2004 | 278 Words</div></section><ul id=tags><li><a href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/tags/programming>programming</a></li></ul></div><div><a class=previous href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/a-little-bad-poetry/>A little bad poetry</a>
