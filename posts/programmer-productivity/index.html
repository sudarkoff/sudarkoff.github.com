I flipped through literally thousands of lines of code, I set dozens of breakpoints only to realize that those places were being hit hundreds of times, and it is virtually impossible to debug it that way. I tried everything I could think of, but nothing helped and by the end of the day I was totally exhausted and pretty much ready to choke somebody.</p><p>I made no progress whatsoever!</p><p>So, at about 8 p.m. I decided to take a break. I stopped the hunt, prepared myself a tiny cup of light and at the same time velvety espresso made of South American premium Arabica beans, made myself comfortable, took a big sip of coffee and let my mind wander&mldr;</p><p><em>&mldr;Ecstatic feelings started filling up my heart, the time paused, allowing me to experience every bit of the surrounding reality in vivid intricacy. I could touch the sound waves coming from two fans in my computer, I could taste every single red photon spitted out by the stupid optical mouse&mldr;</em></p><p>I shook my head (nice coffee!) and, oh miracle, I spotted the defective piece of code in my mind. I immediately jumped to the computer, grabbed the keyboard and started typing&mldr; In a few seconds the bug was gone - one line of code did it. <strong>That was the only line of code I managed to write in a whole long day!</strong></p><p>Now tell me, what is the measure of a programmer&rsquo;s productivity!? Definitely not the number of lines of code written per day! In fact, I think those programmers are really productive whose ratio between added and removed code is approaching zero.</p></article></div></section><aside id=meta><div><section><div id=post-date>Dec 18, 2003 | 307 Words</div></section><ul id=tags><li><a href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/tags/programming>programming</a></li><li><a href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/tags/productivity>productivity</a></li></ul></div><div><a class=previous href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/andrew-bely/>Анупадака Белый</a>
