And they judge harshly those who can&rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.</p><p>An obsession either gives or robs you of power. An obsession with something seemingly productive could be just as destructive to your body and soul. A gym junky is often just as unhealthy (or worse) as a couch potato.</p><p>What makes the difference is how you relate to your obsession. &ldquo;Resist it,&rdquo; continues Oscar Wilde, &ldquo;and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.&rdquo;</p><p>Have you noticed how the harder you resist that cake, the more of it you&rsquo;ll eat after everybody goes to bed? (Substitute with your vice if cake doesn&rsquo;t resonate.)</p><p>Yielding to a temptation doesn&rsquo;t mean letting it control your life. Quite the opposite, it means acknowledging the obsession, and either allowing it to pass without resisting, or learning to engage with it in a balanced and unburdened way.</p></article></div></section><aside id=meta><div><section><div id=post-date>Feb 15, 2023 | 225 Words</div></section><ul id=tags><li><a href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/tags/self-improvement>self-improvement</a></li></ul></div><div><a class=previous href=https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/distributed-ops-proposal/>Distributed Ops for Distributed Apps</a></div></aside><div id=footer><hr><div><a href=https://sudarkoff.com><img alt=Coaching src=/img/gs-logo.svg></a>&nbsp;
