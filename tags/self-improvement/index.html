And they judge harshly those who can&rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.</p></section></div><div class=meta>Feb 15, 2023 | 225 Words | <a href=/posts/yield-to-temptation/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/>Does It Make You A Better Person?</a></h2><div><section><p>Does running make you a better person? Does climbing mountains make you a better person? Does becoming a parent make you a better person?</p><p>Some people seem to believe that it does. And there are plenty of those (especially those that don&rsquo;t run, climb, or have kids) who believe that it doesn&rsquo;t. And I tend to agree with them.</p><p>My deep conviction is that nothing extrinsic can ever make you a better person. Or a worse person, for that mater. Being rich won&rsquo;t make you a better person. Being poor won&rsquo;t either. Believing in God won&rsquo;t make you a better person. Nor being an atheist. Surviving cancer or becoming terminally ill won&rsquo;t make you a better person. And even helping others won&rsquo;t magically turn you into a better person.</p></section></div><div class=meta>Sep 3, 2014 | 253 Words | <a href=/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Rock climbing lessons</a></h2><div><section><p>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.</p><h2 id=dont-give-up>Don&rsquo;t give up</h2><p>Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there. If you are persistent and don&rsquo;t give up, you sooner or later find your groove and come on top victorious.</p></section></div><div class=meta>Nov 5, 2012 | 1337 Words | <a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/dvorak-progress-update/>Dvorak, progress update</a></h2><div><section><p>It&rsquo;s been six months since I switched to Dvorak.
