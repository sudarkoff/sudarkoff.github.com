People believe that giving in to a temptation is a weakness. And they judge harshly those who can&rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.</section></div><div class=meta>Feb 15, 2023 | 225 Words | <a href=/posts/yield-to-temptation/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/>Does It Make You A Better Person?</a></h2><div><section>Does running make you a better person? Does climbing mountains make you a better person? Does becoming a parent make you a better person?
Some people seem to believe that it does. And there are plenty of those (especially those that don&rsquo;t run, climb, or have kids) who believe that it doesn&rsquo;t. And I tend to agree with them.
My deep conviction is that nothing extrinsic can ever make you a better person.</section></div><div class=meta>Sep 3, 2014 | 253 Words | <a href=/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Rock climbing lessons</a></h2><div><section>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.
Don&rsquo;t give up Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there.</section></div><div class=meta>Nov 5, 2012 | 1337 Words | <a href=/posts/climbing-lessons/>Read more…</a></div><h2><a href=/posts/dvorak-progress-update/>Dvorak, progress update</a></h2><div><section>It&rsquo;s been six months since I switched to Dvorak. My current typing speed is 56 words per minute with the average error rate of 6.4%.
It is slightly slower than the 60 wpm I had with QWERTY just before the switch. And the error rate should be below 5% to consider my typing accurate.
Some might say that it&rsquo;s a failed experiment—not only do I not type 40% faster than I did before the switch, as I hoped, my typing is also slightly less accurate.</section></div><div class=meta>Aug 16, 2006 | 160 Words | <a href=/posts/dvorak-progress-update/>Read more…</a></div><div id=footer><hr><div><a href=https://sudarkoff.com><img alt=Coaching src=/img/gs-logo.svg></a>&nbsp;
