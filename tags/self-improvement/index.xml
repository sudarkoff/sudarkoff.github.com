People believe that giving in to a temptation is a weakness. And they judge harshly those who can&amp;rsquo;t resist their unhealthy urges. Yet, they don&amp;rsquo;t apply the same standard to people obsessed with, say, sports or arts. The difference between these two is thinner than most think.</description></item><item><title>Does It Make You A Better Person?</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/does-it-make-you-a-better-person/</guid><description>Does running make you a better person? Does climbing mountains make you a better person? Does becoming a parent make you a better person?
Some people seem to believe that it does. And there are plenty of those (especially those that don&amp;rsquo;t run, climb, or have kids) who believe that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. And I tend to agree with them.
My deep conviction is that nothing extrinsic can ever make you a better person.</description></item><item><title>Rock climbing lessons</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/climbing-lessons/</guid><description>There are many lessons to be learned from rock climbing, but the following three are the main ones for me.
Don&amp;rsquo;t give up Very often giving up in rock climbing is scarier than persisting—nobody likes falling. Especially if it&amp;rsquo;s a long and nasty fall. And what you very quickly discover is that in rock climbing, like in life (or Jazz, if you&amp;rsquo;re a musician), sticking with it for long enough eventually gets you up there.</description></item><item><title>Dvorak, progress update</title><link>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/dvorak-progress-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2006 16:18:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://george.sudarkoff.com/posts/dvorak-progress-update/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been six months since I switched to Dvorak. My current typing speed is 56 words per minute with the average error rate of 6.4%.
It is slightly slower than the 60 wpm I had with QWERTY just before the switch. And the error rate should be below 5% to consider my typing accurate.
Some might say that it&amp;rsquo;s a failed experiment—not only do I not type 40% faster than I did before the switch, as I hoped, my typing is also slightly less accurate.</description></item></channel></rss>
